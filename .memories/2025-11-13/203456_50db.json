  "description": "Plan created for semantic search review fixes. Rejected Issue #7 (context parameter) based on evidence from TODO.md showing we already tested code_context inclusion (2025-11-11) and it caused 4x database growth (50MB→203MB) and significantly slower embedding generation with no quality improvement. BGE-Small truncates at 512 tokens so most context was wasted. Removing context gave 75-88% speed improvement while maintaining search quality. Parameter kept with underscore prefix as intentional design. Prioritized remaining 6 issues: #1 ordering bug (critical-wrong results), #2 N×2 queries (performance cliff), #3 validation (crash prevention), #4 model collisions (architecture), #5 hard-coded dimensions (maintainability), #6 serialization (micro-opt).",
