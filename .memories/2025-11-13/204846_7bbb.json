  "description": "TDD RED phase complete for Issue #1 (ordering bug). Wrote test_get_symbols_by_ids_preserves_order that proves get_symbols_by_ids() returns rows in arbitrary order (alphabetically by ID) instead of requested order. Test correctly fails: requested ['ppp_fourth', 'aaa_first', 'zzz_last', 'mmm_middle'] but got 'aaa_first' first. This confirms semantic search pairs similarity scores with wrong symbols. Fix needed: add ORDER BY clause with CASE statement or HashMap remapping to preserve input order. Ready for GREEN phase implementation.",
