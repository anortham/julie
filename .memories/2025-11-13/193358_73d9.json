  "description": "Implemented markdown empty heading skip optimization for cleaner semantic embeddings. Skip embedding markdown headings without doc_comment (structural dividers like \"## Core Features\"), consistent with memory JSON optimization. Added 4 comprehensive tests: with content (embedded), empty (skipped), empty string (skipped), and non-markdown unchanged. All 25 embedding tests pass. Expected 18-22% reduction in markdown embeddings with clearer semantic signal. Rationale: RAG philosophy - \"One concept per embedding\" means skip metadata, embed content only.",
