  "description": "Fixed Windows path separator bug in test cleanup safety checks: Added support for backslash path separators (\\fixtures\\test-workspaces\\) in addition to forward slashes. This resolved 3 of 4 test failures (FTS5 minimal corruption tests and reference workspace tests). Remaining failures are Windows file locking concurrency issues (pass with --test-threads=1). Test suite now at 1733/1736 passing (99.8%).",
