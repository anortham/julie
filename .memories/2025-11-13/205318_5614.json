  "description": "Fixed Issue #1: Result ordering nondeterminism in get_symbols_by_ids. Added ORDER BY CASE statement to preserve input order, preventing semantic search from pairing similarity scores with wrong symbols. Used full TDD cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR). Test: test_get_symbols_by_ids_preserves_order, all 34 database tests passing.",
