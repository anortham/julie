  "description": "Validated markdown empty heading optimization in production. After reindexing with new code: 545 embeddings created (only content-bearing symbols), 123 empty structural headings correctly skipped, achieving 18.4% embedding reduction. Semantic search working correctly - query \"add language support\" successfully found relevant documentation with rich content. No empty headings appearing in search results. Optimization confirms RAG principle: skip metadata, embed content only.",
