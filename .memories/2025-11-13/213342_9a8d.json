  "description": "Released v1.7.8 with 6 critical semantic search fixes and performance improvements. Fixed ordering bug (similarity scores paired with wrong symbols), N×2 database hits (400 queries → 1 via batch fetching), vector validation, vector ID collisions (composite keys with :: delimiter), hard-coded dimensions (dimension-aware LoadedHnswIndex), and serialization performance (2-3x faster). Added 722 lines of comprehensive tests with full TDD cycle. Fixed minor code quality issues (test assertion operator precedence). Updated JULIE_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md with mandatory memory system protocols. All 1,746 tests passing. Commit 485d7b7, tag v1.7.8 pushed to origin.",
