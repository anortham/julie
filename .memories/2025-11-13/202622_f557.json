  "description": "Comprehensive verification of semantic search review completed. Confirmed 7 critical issues: (1) Nondeterministic result ordering in get_symbols_by_ids - WHERE id IN() with no ORDER BY causes similarity scores paired with wrong symbols; (2) Context parameter unused in embed_symbol - accepts CodeContext but ignores it; (3) Hard-coded dimensions (384) in multiple locations; (4) N×2 database hits per query - get_embedding_for_symbol does 2 queries per neighbor, 400 total for 200 neighbors; (5) Vector ID collisions across models - using symbol_id as vector_id with PRIMARY KEY overwrites when switching models; (6) CPU-heavy serialization - flat_map with to_le_bytes creates many small allocations; (7) No vector length validation before storage. Created todo list with 8 items prioritized by impact.",
