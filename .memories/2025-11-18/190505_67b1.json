  "description": "Updated GPU_SETUP.md with critical WSL2 and MCP server configuration that was missing. Added: (1) WSL2-specific installation using wsl-ubuntu repository and apt for cuDNN, (2) Critical MCP server configuration section explaining LD_LIBRARY_PATH must include BOTH target/release (for ONNX Runtime libs) and /usr/local/cuda-12.6/lib64 (for CUDA libs), (3) Troubleshooting for libonnxruntime_providers_shared.so error, (4) Shell detection (zsh vs bash), (5) Debugging with RUST_LOG. Also implemented CUDA GPU memory detection using nvidia-smi to calculate dynamic batch sizes (will reduce VRAM from 5.5GB to ~4.2GB using DirectML-safe formula). Key insight: MCP servers don't inherit shell environment, so claude_desktop_config.json env configuration is mandatory.",
