  "description": "Revised GPU_SETUP.md to REMOVE recommendation for RUST_LOG=ort=trace after user reported it generated 12GB+ log files. Changed troubleshooting to use safe diagnostic commands (grep existing logs, watch nvidia-smi) instead of verbose trace logging. Added strong warning that ort=trace should NEVER be used - fills disk rapidly. Kept optional julie=debug for Julie-specific debugging only. Key lesson: Default INFO-level logs are sufficient for troubleshooting; trace logging in ONNX Runtime is for library developers only, not end users.",
