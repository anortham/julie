  "description": "Improved HNSW index warning logging in file watcher. Changed \"HNSW index not loaded\" from WARNING to DEBUG level since it's expected behavior during initial indexing. The HNSW index loads on-demand (first semantic search call), so file watcher warnings were misleading. Now only actual errors show as warnings. Added explanatory message: \"HNSW index not yet loaded (loads on first semantic search, embeddings saved to SQLite)\".",
