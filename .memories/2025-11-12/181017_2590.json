  "description": "Validated 100KB file size limit for symbol extraction through empirical analysis of 1,602 files across 5+ projects (julie, PsychiatricIntake, CoA Intranet, PrimexNotifier, behavioral-adoption). Found 97% of files under 100KB, 98th percentile at 89.7KB, and all 49 files >100KB are third-party libraries. Largest legitimate user code is 71.3KB (app.seed.js). Decision: Keep 100KB limit - it's data-driven with 29KB safety margin above largest legitimate file, not a guess. Recommended adding recursion depth limit as belt-and-suspenders protection.",
