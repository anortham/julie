  "description": "Added 100KB file size limit for symbol extraction - discovered tokio::time::timeout doesn't work with spawn_blocking (can't interrupt OS threads doing CPU work). Files >100KB now skip symbol extraction but still indexed for text search. Fixes hang on demo-data.js (158KB) and dygraph-combined.js (413KB).",
