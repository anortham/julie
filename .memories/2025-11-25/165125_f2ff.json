  "description": "Completed comprehensive code review of Julie for production stability. Found the codebase to be very solid with proper security (FTS5 sanitization, path traversal protection), good concurrency handling (9 documented deadlock fixes), proper resource cleanup (Drop impls for DB, HNSW, ORT), and extensive test coverage (42k lines). Minor concerns: ort 2.0.0-rc.10 is a release candidate, 2 minor TODOs in prod code, and some style warnings from clippy.",
