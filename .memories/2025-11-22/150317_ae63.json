  "description": "Session complete: (1) Implemented lean output formats for 5 tools (fast_search, fast_refs, fast_goto, trace_call_path, get_symbols) with 60-80% token savings. (2) Discovered and documented critical cross-file relationship bug - trace_call_path fails because relationships point to Import symbols not actual Function definitions. Created 3 failing tests in src/tests/extractors/rust/cross_file_relationships.rs. Added comprehensive fix plan to TODO.md with Option A (post-indexing resolution) as the professional long-term solution. Ready to implement PendingRelationship struct in next context.",
