  "description": "Verified cross-file relationship resolution is working end-to-end. After rebuild and force re-index: 10,452 relationships (up from ~2,491). trace_call_path now returns actual code callers across file boundaries. Tested with find_symbols_by_name (found 2 cross-file callers) and extract_symbols_and_relationships (found 42 callers across test files). Bug fix complete and verified in production.",
