  "description": "Completed cross-file relationship resolution for ALL 21 programming languages. Started with 7 languages (Rust, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, C++), then used parallel TDD agents to implement 12 more (JavaScript, C, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, PHP, Ruby, Lua, Zig, GDScript, Bash, PowerShell), and finally added QML and R after audit revealed they had call detection but no cross-file support. 1931 tests pass. Tree-sitter implementation is now complete for cross-file call tracking - the foundation for trace_call_path.",
