  "description": "Major refactor: Extracted julie-extractors as standalone crate. Created cargo workspace structure with julie-extractors containing all 31 language extractors, tree-sitter dependencies, and 1,094 tests. Julie now depends on the crate via re-exports for backward compatibility. Miller can now depend on julie-extractors via git instead of copy-paste. Total 1,931 tests passing (1,094 extractors + 837 Julie).",
