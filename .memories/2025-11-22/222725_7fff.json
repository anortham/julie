Key priorities: P0 = Editing tools (edit_lines, fuzzy_replace, rename_symbol, edit_symbol), P1 = fast_explore modes (logic, similar, dependencies), P2 = Lean grep-style output format, P3 = Workspace health diagnostics, P4 = Token optimization utilities. All recommended as pure Python implementations. Estimated 4 weeks of work total.",
