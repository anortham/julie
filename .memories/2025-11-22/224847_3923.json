  "description": "Completed thorough audit of Julie vs Miller. Found 90% feature overlap. Key findings: (1) Miller already has lean output and workspace health, (2) Miller has pattern search that Julie lacks, (3) Only real gap is fast_explore modes (logic/similar/dependencies). Updated PORT_PLAN.md with accurate comparison table and revised priorities.",
