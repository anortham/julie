  "description": "Created failing tests for cross-file relationship bug. Found two distinct issues: (1) Function calls that resolve to import symbols point to the Import not the actual Function definition - useless for trace_call_path; (2) Method calls to imported types create NO relationships at all. Tests in src/tests/extractors/rust/cross_file_relationships.rs document these bugs clearly.",
