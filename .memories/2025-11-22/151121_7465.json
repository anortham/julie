  "description": "Implemented PendingRelationship infrastructure for cross-file call resolution. Added PendingRelationship struct to types.rs, updated ExtractionResults to include pending_relationships field, modified Rust extractor to create PendingRelationship when target is Import or not found (instead of creating useless relationships pointing to Import symbols). Updated 3 cross-file relationship tests to verify new behavior. All 1862 tests pass. Next step: Add resolution pass in database/indexing to resolve pending relationships to actual function definitions after workspace indexing completes.",
