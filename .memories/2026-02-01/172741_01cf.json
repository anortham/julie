  "description": "Comprehensive Miller vs Julie comparison complete. Identified 9 potential backports: (1) Cross-encoder re-ranking for semantic search improvement, (2) Self-healing bootstrap script pattern, (3) User-level project registry for cross-project memory search/standups, (4) Transitive closure table for O(1) impact analysis, (5) JINA code-specific embeddings option, (6) Markdown+YAML frontmatter memory format, (7) Blake3 hashing in Rust for staleness detection, (8) Arrow IPC for zero-copy data transfer (future), (9) Matryoshka embeddings for faster search (future). Key architecture insight: Miller proved Python/Rust hybrid works but deployment complexity is painful - validates Julie's pure-Rust approach. Miller's main wins are GPU acceleration (PyTorch) and easier ML model access.",
