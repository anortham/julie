  "description": "Released v1.10.1 with comprehensive regression prevention tests. Added 5 tests covering recurring bugs: WAL growth prevention (109MB → <20MB), GPU/CPU logging accuracy (is_using_gpu() consistency), batch size caching (239 calls spam → 1 call), bounds validation [25-250], and Linux CUDA workaround. All tests passing. Identified issue: Linux CUDA workaround too broad (forces CPU for ALL Linux, not just CUDA 13.0). Deep review of commit 8543ee0 confirmed all changes accurate. Tests protect against regressions during refactoring.",
