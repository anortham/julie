  "description": "SESSION COMPLETE - Phase 1 & 2: TOON Optimization Major Milestone. Phase 1: Fixed critical fallback bugs in fast_refs/fast_search (broke MCP contract by returning text instead of structured JSON on TOON failure), fixed 49 test compilation errors, restored test suite (1,804 passing). Phase 2: Added TOON support to fast_goto (50-70% token savings), standardized trace_call_path parameter (Option<String> consistency). Discovered behavioral adoption gap: agent used sed instead of fuzzy_replace despite docs - need WHEN/WHY guidance not just WHAT/HOW. Committed and pushed 54 files (1,864 insertions, 283 deletions). All changes safe in git. Ready for Phase 3: shared create_toonable_result() helper to eliminate 120 lines duplication. Session achievements: 2 critical bugs fixed, 1 tool gained TOON, 49 test errors fixed, full consistency, major learning documented.",
