  "description": "Cleaned up Phase 5a dead code. Removed unreachable filtering logic from search/mod.rs (35 lines), removed filter_high_confidence and group_by_file_top_match functions from shared.rs with traits and implementations (320 lines), removed 11 dead tests. All 1,831 tests passing. Phase 5a now delivers 80% token reduction purely through default limit changes (50→10) with no confusing dead code."
