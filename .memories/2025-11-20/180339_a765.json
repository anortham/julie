  "description": "Fixed critical TOON integration bugs: (1) Removed structured_content when using TOON to avoid double-sending data (was wasting tokens not saving them!), (2) Created ToonSymbol/ToonResponse structs with primitives-only to trigger compact CSV-style encoding instead of verbose YAML (metadata HashMap was causing fallback). Consulted Gemini + toon-rust source to understand uniform array detection logic. Ready for testing after rebuild.",
