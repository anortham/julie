Pushed to main branch. 30 files changed, 727 insertions, 439 deletions. Complete milestone: Created shared create_toonable_result() helper eliminating 230 lines duplication across 4 tools (fast_refs, fast_goto, find_logic, trace_call_path). Fixed all 32 test failures from dual-output elimination. Final test suite: 1845 passing, 0 failing. Code quality dramatically improved, single source of truth for TOON logic, future-proof architecture. Phase 3 roadmap 100% complete, production ready.",
