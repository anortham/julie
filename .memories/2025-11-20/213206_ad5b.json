  "description": "Phase 5 Hierarchical TOON Optimization - Design Complete! trace_call_path identified as \"token monster\" (10k-30k chars) with YAML-ish fallback. Designed single flat table approach with trait-based architecture for maximum token efficiency (63% reduction, 77% combined with Phase 4). Key insight: Both JSON and TOON are for AI/machine consumption, not humans - optimize purely for token efficiency, parseability, lossless data, reconstruction via parent_id. Architecture: HierarchicalToonable trait + FlatNode<T> struct with id/parent_id/group/level fields. Reusable for trace_call_path, get_symbols, any hierarchical data. Ready to implement following TDD in fresh context. Saved complete design to TODO.md with example output, implementation steps, success criteria.",
