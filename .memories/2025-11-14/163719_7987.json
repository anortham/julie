  "description": "Completed TDD RED phase for Bug #2 (vector store reload). Created comprehensive failing test in src/tests/integration/vector_store_reload.rs that reproduces the bug: manual reindex builds new HNSW and saves to disk but in-memory vector store never refreshes. Test verifies that semantic search returns stale results after reindex (without restart). Includes 3 test scenarios: (1) vector store reload after manual reindex, (2) staleness detection via on-disk timestamp, (3) concurrent search safety during reload. Test compiles successfully, marked #[ignore] until fix implemented. Registered in src/tests/mod.rs. Ready for GREEN phase (implementation).",
