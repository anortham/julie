  "description": "Completed Bug #2 fix implementation (TDD GREEN phase). Added load_time: Option<SystemTime> field to VectorStore struct (vector_store.rs:37), updated load_hnsw_index() to record SystemTime::now() on line 235, added get_load_time() public getter (line 59-61). Implemented staleness detection in semantic_search_impl() (semantic_search.rs:309-345): checks hnsw_index.hnsw.graph file mtime vs in-memory load_time, reloads if on-disk is newer. Uses read lock to check staleness, upgrades to write lock only for reload operation. Graceful degradation: continues with stale index if reload fails. Code compiles successfully with no errors. Ready for test verification.",
