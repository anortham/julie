  "description": "Fixed Finding #5 (P1): Semantic search filtering under-delivery. Implemented dynamic widening loop with 3-attempt retry strategy (50→100→200→500 candidates). Search now delivers full requested limit even when filters are restrictive. Added integration tests in semantic_filtering.rs. All 1748 tests passing, zero regressions. Files: semantic_search.rs (lines 404-603), semantic_filtering.rs (new), docs/SEMANTIC_SEARCH_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md (4/5 complete).",
