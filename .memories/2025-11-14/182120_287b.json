  "description": "Phase 1 Progress: Factory now returns ExtractionResults with types+identifiers fields. Changed extract_symbols_and_relationships() return type from tuple to ExtractionResults struct. Updated indexing/extractor.rs to destructure results. Currently returning empty Vec/HashMap for types and identifiers (will populate from extractors next). All code compiles cleanly. Ready to wire up actual extraction calls for TypeScript (which already has extract_identifiers and infer_types implemented).",
