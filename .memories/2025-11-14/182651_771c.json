  "description": "TypeScript Identifier+Type Extraction WIRED UP: Factory now returns ExtractionResults with full data. TypeScript extractor calls extract_identifiers() and infer_types() - both already implemented! Indexing pipeline updated to receive ExtractionResults. All code compiles cleanly. Database corrupted during development - cleared and ready for re-index. TypeScript is now the reference implementation for other 29 languages. Ready to add bulk storage calls and test with Julie's own TS codebase.",
