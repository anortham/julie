  "description": "Task 7: Rewritten text_search_impl to use Tantivy instead of FTS5. Key changes: (1) Removed query expansion (now handled by CodeTokenizer at index time), (2) Removed FTS5 preprocessing, (3) Added direct Tantivy SearchIndex calls for both symbol and content search, (4) Implemented SymbolSearchResult → Symbol and ContentSearchResult → Symbol conversion, (5) Used tokio::task::spawn_blocking for Mutex access, (6) Applied glob filtering post-search, (7) Marked FTS5 functions as dead code for Task 10 removal. Code compiles successfully (cargo check). Tests created in src/tests/tools/text_search_tantivy.rs (7 tests for integration testing).",
