  "description": "Completed Task 7: Rewrite text_search_impl to use Tantivy. Found and fixed critical BooleanQuery bug: Tantivy's Should clauses are optional when Must clauses present — must wrap term matches in nested BooleanQuery as Must. Also fixed tokenizer dropping segments with punctuation like `println!` by expanding delimiter set to include `!@#$%^&*+=|~/\\``. Commits: 4a1621d (rewrite), f3e32dc (bug fixes).",
