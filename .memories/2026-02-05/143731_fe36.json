  "description": "Completed Task 9: Simplified search method routing. All search methods (text, semantic, hybrid, auto) now route to text_search_impl (Tantivy). Removed 150-line semantic fallback block from call_tool. detect_search_method always returns \"text\". Marked semantic_search.rs and hybrid_search.rs as deprecated with #![allow(dead_code)] for Phase 3 removal. Updated auto_detection tests. Net -319 lines. Commit: dfa5c82.",
