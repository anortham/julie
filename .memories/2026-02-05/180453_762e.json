  "description": "Dead code cleanup complete. Removed 777 lines across 19 files: hybrid_search.rs stub, query_expansion.rs (10 deprecated FTS5 functions), detect_search_method(), are_embeddings_ready(), auto_detection_tests, hybrid_search_tests, 15 quality.rs tests for dead imports. Renamed sqlite_fts_ready → search_ready across 8 files. Fixed stale FTS5 comments in fast_refs.rs and processor.rs. Zero regressions (667 pass / 29 pre-existing fail). Also discovered Tantivy index not auto-populated on upgrade — needs force re-index after v1→v2 migration (tracked as task #15).",
