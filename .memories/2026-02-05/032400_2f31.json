  "description": "Completed design for replacing FTS5 with Tantivy + CodeTokenizer. Design doc at docs/plans/2026-02-04-tantivy-search-engine-design.md. Key decisions: (1) Tantivy replaces both FTS5 tables (symbols + file content), (2) CodeTokenizer ported from Razorback with CamelCase/snake_case splitting at index time, (3) Per-language TOML configs embedded in binary, (4) ORT/HNSW removed entirely, (5) One Tantivy index per workspace, (6) 4-phase implementation: add alongside → switch over → remove old → complete features. Razorback's unfinished features (meaningful_affixes, strip_prefixes/suffixes, important_patterns scoring) will be completed during integration.",
