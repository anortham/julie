## Dogfood Verification: Both Search + Extractor Fixes Confirmed Live

### file_pattern fix (commit `0aedd9c`)
- Already verified in previous session — 4/6 original failing queries now return results
- 2 "failures" were user error (wrong path prefix), confirmed correct behavior

### impl super:: extractor fix (commit `92663d3`)
- Reindexed: **24,022 symbols** (up from 23,862 = +160 new symbols)
- `get_symbols(target="is_environment_variable")` on `bash/variables.rs` → **found** (was "No symbols found")
- `bash/variables.rs`: 4 methods now visible (was 0 methods, only imports + static)
- `go/identifiers.rs`: 3 methods now visible (was 0)
- 160 newly-indexed symbols are `impl super::` methods across 15+ extractor files

### Status
- Both commits on `main`, release built, workspace reindexed
- All search and extractor tests passing (7/7 line_mode, 60/60 Rust extractor)
