## Round 6: Final Three Extractors B+ → A — All 30 A-Rated

### What Was Done
- 7 tasks across 7 commits, 20 new tests (1277 → 1297 total)
- **PHP B+ → A**: Anonymous classes as `SymbolKind::Class` with `anonymous_class_L{line}` naming, extends/implements in signature + metadata, proper child parenting. Arrow functions verified as already handled via `extract_variable_assignment`.
- **Vue B+ → A**: Style section expanded with `CSS_ID_RE` and `CSS_CUSTOM_PROP_RE` LazyLock regexes. ID selectors → `SymbolKind::Property`, CSS custom properties → `SymbolKind::Variable`.
- **YAML B+ → A**: Container keys (with nested `block_mapping`) → `SymbolKind::Module`, leaf keys stay `Variable`. Aliases (`*name`) extracted as `IdentifierKind::VariableRef` with anchor resolution. Merge keys (`<<`) filtered from symbols.

### Final Ratings
- **30 A-rated** extractors (was 28 A + 3 B+)
- **0 B+, 0 B, 0 C, 0 D**
- B tier completely eliminated across all 30 languages
