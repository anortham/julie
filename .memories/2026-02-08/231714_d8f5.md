## Fix Rust Extractor: impl super::Type Methods Not Extracted

### Root Cause
`extract_impl()` in `crates/julie-extractors/src/rust/functions.rs` only looked for
`type_identifier` children of `impl_item` nodes. But `impl super::Foo` produces a
`scoped_type_identifier` child instead. The function returned early, silently dropping
the entire impl block and all its methods.

### Impact
- **15+ files** in the Julie codebase use `impl super::ExtractorName` pattern
- All methods in those files were invisible to `get_symbols` and the index
- Affects Go, Bash, Razor, JavaScript, and other extractor modules

### Fix
- Added `scoped_type_identifier` handling alongside `type_identifier` in `extract_impl()`
- For scoped types, extracts the last `type_identifier` segment as the type name
  (e.g., `BashExtractor` from `super::BashExtractor`)
- 6-line change in the `find_map` closure

### Tests (TDD)
- **RED**: 2 new failing tests (`test_impl_methods_extracted_with_scoped_type`,
  `test_impl_methods_extracted_with_crate_scoped_type`)
- **GREEN**: Both pass after fix
- **60/60** Rust extractor tests pass, 0 regressions

### Files Changed
- `crates/julie-extractors/src/rust/functions.rs` — Fix in `extract_impl()`
- `crates/julie-extractors/src/tests/rust/extractor.rs` — 3 new tests
