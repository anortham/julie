## Session Summary: 5 Commits Across Search, Extractors, and Tools

### Commits
1. `0aedd9c` — **fix(search)**: file_pattern/language filtering moved before limit cap in all 3 search paths
2. `92663d3` — **fix(rust)**: `scoped_type_identifier` handling in impl block extraction (+160 symbols indexed)
3. `ad9fcf3` — **docs(tools)**: deep_dive promoted with Critical Rule 4, adoption triggers, workflow integration
4. `4a19b7c` — **chore(razor)**: removed dead `extract_assignment` + `extract_element_access` (zero warnings)
5. `25f9284` — **fix(symbols)**: `get_symbols` with `target` + `mode=\"minimal\"` now includes code body for child symbols

### Key Findings
- `deep_dive` wasn't getting called because it lacked adoption patterns: no Critical Rule, no \"Always use BEFORE\" triggers, missing from workflows
- `get_symbols` with `target` on a child method returned signature-only in `minimal` mode — body stripped because `parent_id.is_none()` was false
- Build had 1 warning from dead Razor extractor methods — cleaned up

### Tests
- 28/28 get_symbols tests pass (1 new)
- 7/7 line_mode search tests pass (2 un-ignored)
- 60/60 Rust extractor tests pass (3 new)
- Zero build warnings
