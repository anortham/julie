## Architectural Decision: Julie/Goldfish Separation

### Decision
Split code intelligence and work management into two separate MCP servers:
- **Julie** = pure code intelligence (6 tools: `fast_search`, `get_symbols`, `deep_dive`, `fast_refs`, `rename_symbol`, `manage_workspace`)
- **Goldfish** (revived from `c:\source\goldfish`) = work management / memories (`checkpoint`, `recall`, `plan`, `store`, standup)

### Rationale
- Julie's memory tools were shoehorned in because semantic embedding infrastructure existed at the time — that infrastructure is now removed
- Memory/planning tools are CRUD on markdown files, not code intelligence
- Julie is project-scoped; work management needs to be user-scoped and cross-project
- Goldfish v4 (Bun/TS) already exists with 252 passing tests
- Superpowers planning skills make Julie's `plan` tool redundant (320 tokens/session wasted)
- Clean separation: Julie knows code, Goldfish knows work

### Format Standardization
- Goldfish will adopt Julie's YAML frontmatter + markdown format for checkpoints (replacing daily aggregate markdown)
- One file per entry (not daily aggregate) — simpler, more git-friendly
- Enables Goldfish to read existing Julie `.memories/*.md` files for migration
- Only conversion needed: Unix timestamp (Julie) ↔ ISO 8601 (Goldfish)

### What Changes
**Julie removes**: `checkpoint`, `recall`, `plan` tools, `src/tools/memory/`, Memory System section from agent instructions, standup skill, PreCompact hook. Drops 9 → 6 tools.
**Goldfish gains**: Updated checkpoint format, standup capability, runs on Windows/Bun

### Also in This Session
- Trimmed `JULIE_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — removed ~70 lines of parameter documentation duplicated by JSON Schema tool descriptions (298 → 228 lines)
