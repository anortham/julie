  "description": "Implemented auto-detection for fast_search tool. Added detect_search_method() function that analyzes query for code pattern indicators (: < > [ ] ( ) { } => ?. &&) and routes to \"text\" search for exact matching or \"hybrid\" for natural language. Default search_method changed from \"text\" to \"auto\". Added 13 comprehensive tests covering inheritance patterns, generics, attributes, function calls, lambdas, null-conditional operators, and natural language queries. All 104 search tests passing. Implementation follows Miller's proven auto-detection strategy adapted for Julie's CASCADE architecture.",
