  "description": "Fixed timezone/time mismatch bug in /recall command causing recent memories to be missed. Root cause: Slash command forced UTC time calculations without knowing current time, causing off-by-minutes errors. Solution: Updated .claude/commands/recall.md to (1) run `date` command to get actual current LOCAL time before calculations, (2) add 10-minute margin for reliability, (3) use local time format (no 'Z') which tool converts to UTC automatically, (4) recommend limit parameter for very recent queries (<30m). The Rust code was already correct - it handles local time properly (recall.rs:26-28). Bug was purely in slash command instructions. Verified fix works: recalled memory from 26 minutes ago using \"1hr\" query with proper time calculation.",
