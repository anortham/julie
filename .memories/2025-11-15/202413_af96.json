  "description": "Candle embedding backend investigation FAILED - Metal slower than CPU, Linux CUDA setup broken. Rolled back hybrid ORT/Candle implementation (commits 6a56f0b-0d691cb nuked). ORT-only is correct choice: works cross-platform, no complexity. Only change preserved: MAX_FILE_SIZE_FOR_SYMBOLS 100KB→500KB for legitimate large source files. Lesson: Don't revisit Candle - ORT already solves the problem.",
