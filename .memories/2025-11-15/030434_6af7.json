  "description": "Fixed two project housekeeping issues: (1) Cleaned up extraneous files from root (rust_out binary, scratch test files, obsolete .codesearchignore), moved CLAUDE.md.archive to docs/archive/. (2) Fixed memory auto-commit workflow by updating .claude/commands/checkpoint.md to automatically commit memory files after creation. Memory files are designed to be git-committed (git-mergeable design) but we were forgetting to commit them consistently. Updated command now includes explicit git add + commit instructions. Committed all changes and pushed to origin/main.",
