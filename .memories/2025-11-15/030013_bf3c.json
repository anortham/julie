  "description": "Released v1.9.1 with 4 critical bug fixes discovered through dogfooding. Committed 2 commits (bug fixes + version bump), tagged v1.9.1, pushed to origin/main with tags. Fixes: (1) fast_refs SQL placeholder bug causing zero results for reference_kind filtering, (2) fast_explore similar mode using bare symbol name instead of full context, (3) fast_explore types mode counting hierarchy.len() instead of actual array lengths, (4) /recall timezone bug forcing UTC without knowing current time. All fixes follow TDD with passing tests. Dogfooding wins - we found the recall bug by using Julie's memory system to develop Julie!",
