  "description": "Gemini TOON Review - Phase 1 Complete: Data Drift Prevention System. Implemented comprehensive field verification tests following TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR). Created toon_struct_verification.rs with 8 passing tests that serve as living documentation and change detection for Symbol ↔ ToonFlatSymbol/ToonSymbol mappings. Fixed data drift bug: ToonSymbol was missing parent_id field (critical for class.method relationships in search results). Added parent_id to ToonSymbol struct and conversion logic, updated all tests. All 1,846 tests passing. Results: ToonFlatSymbol 55% coverage (11/20 fields), ToonSymbol 65% coverage (13/20 fields, improved from 60%). Test suite now alerts us if Symbol gains new fields, forcing conscious review of TOON struct updates. Addresses Gemini's #1 concern: automated struct synchronization verification.",
