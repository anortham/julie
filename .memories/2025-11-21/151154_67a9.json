  "description": "Upgraded to official toon-format v0.3.7 - Round-Trip Capability Restored! Switched from forked version back to official crates.io release. Major discovery: v0.3.7 fixed both the parentheses bug (our PR) AND the Vec<T> deserialization limitation that Gemini was concerned about. Round-trip tests now PASSING: both unwrapped and wrapped OptimizedResponse decode successfully. Updated POC to reflect this improvement - TOON is no longer write-only, it's now a true bidirectional format achieving both token efficiency (35-70% savings) AND programmatic validation. Gemini's Recommendation #2 concern is now completely resolved - TOON supports full round-trips. Our earlier analysis (write-only is acceptable) was correct for v0.3.6, but v0.3.7 exceeded expectations. Updated Cargo.toml: toon-format = \"0.3.7\"",
