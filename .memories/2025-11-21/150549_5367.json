  "description": "Gemini TOON Review - Recommendation #2 Complete: POC Decoding Documented. Investigated TOON decoding fragility and determined it's an expected limitation, not a bug. TOON's compact table notation (results[N]{...}) cannot be deserialized back to Vec<T> in Rust - this is by design. TOON is optimized for LLM reading (35% token savings), not programmatic round-trips. Updated toon_poc.rs with comprehensive documentation explaining this is acceptable: Julie never needs to decode TOON output, LLMs consume it as text directly. Impact: None - write-only format is perfect for our use case. POC now serves as living documentation of TOON's design tradeoffs.",
