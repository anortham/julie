  "description": "Session Complete: Gemini TOON Review + v0.3.7 Upgrade - All Committed and Pushed! Successfully addressed all 3 Gemini recommendations: (1) Data drift prevention test suite (8 tests) catches Symbol schema changes and fixed missing parent_id bug, (2) POC documentation clarified round-trip behavior (v0.3.7 now supports full bidirectional), (3) MCP tool descriptions updated with TOON schema documentation across 6 tools. Upgraded to official toon-format v0.3.7 with round-trip capability. Committed 007d712 with 11 files changed (+331/-17), pushed to main. All 1,846 tests passing. Production ready with 35-70% token savings and full validation support. Excellent collaboration - systematic TDD approach delivered high-quality improvements.",
