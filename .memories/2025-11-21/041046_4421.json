  "description": "Fixed fast_explore TOON encoding issue - discovered TOON library can't encode bare f32 fields, only Option<f32>. After systematic testing of all tools (fast_search, fast_goto, fast_refs, get_symbols, trace_call_path all working), found that find_logic (fast_explore) was returning JSON instead of TOON. Root cause: BusinessLogicSymbol had confidence: f32 while all working tools use Option<f32> for float fields. Changed confidence to Option<f32>, wrapped values in Some() when creating instances, and unwrapped for display. This matches the pattern in ToonSymbol and ToonFlatCallPathNode. Critical learning: TOON encoder handles primitives (String, u32) and Option<T> but not bare floating point types. All 6 major tools now confirmed working with true tabular TOON format (not YAML fallback).",
