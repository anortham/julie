  "description": "Critical bug found: Windows file_pattern normalization converts forward slashes to backslashes, breaking ALL GLOB pattern searches on Windows. Located in src/database/files.rs:388-389. Violates RELATIVE_PATHS_CONTRACT.md. Exposed by memory system text search returning 0 results while semantic search worked. Direct SQL proved FTS5 works with forward-slash patterns, fails with backslash patterns. Fix: Remove platform-specific slash conversion, use forward slashes everywhere per Julie's cross-platform contract.",
