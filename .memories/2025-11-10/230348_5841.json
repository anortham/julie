  "description": "Fixed 6 flaky tests that failed in parallel execution! Root causes: (1) Parallel temp directory conflicts - created unique_temp_dir() helper with atomic counter, (2) Production directory cleanup panic - removed dangerous atomic_cleanup_julie_dir() calls trying to delete project root .julie directory. Fixed tests: test_incremental_indexing_absolute_path_handling, test_file_deletion_absolute_path, test_file_rename_absolute_paths, test_cross_language_real_world_integration. Also fixed test_real_world_jsonl_memories_fixture and test_process_phrase_query which only failed due to test pollution. New helper prevents future parallel test conflicts.",
