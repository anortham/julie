  "description": "Released v1.5.4 with critical Windows .julieignore bug fix! Pattern matching was comparing Windows backslash paths against Unix forward-slash patterns, causing ALL ignore rules to fail on Windows. Added path normalization before pattern matching. Also includes MCP connection failure fixes from commit 9bc3d54. Test suite: 1655/1661 passing (99.6%), 6 flaky tests pass individually. Tag v1.5.4 created and pushed to main.",
