  "description": "Added custom slash commands /checkpoint and /recall for ergonomic memory system access. Commands use correct frontmatter format with allowed-tools. /checkpoint supports interactive mode (analyzes context), direct mode (with description), and typed mode (--type flag). /recall supports time-based (30m, 3h, 1d limited for context efficiency), topic-based (hybrid search: FTS5 + semantic), and filtered queries (--type, --since). README.md provides user-facing documentation.",
