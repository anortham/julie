Completed dogfood testing of trace_call_path (Task #3). Ran 8 test scenarios against Julie's own codebase. Key findings: (1) direction=both is broken — only shows upstream, mis-labels as "callees"; (2) ~40% of leaf nodes are false positives from stdlib/trait method names (to_string, clone, insert, len) resolving to fixture files; (3) method calls on structs not tracked (row_to_symbol has 10 callers per fast_refs but trace returns nothing); (4) struct/type symbols get misleading "try cross_language" error. Positives: lean format is excellent, depth limiting works perfectly, performance is great, high-level call chains are accurate and useful.
