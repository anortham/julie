Completed factory.rs refactor: 1007→456 lines. Added convert_types_map helper to eliminate 22 copy-paste blocks. Fixed _identifiers/_types variable naming. Organized match arms by capability tier. Created missing test_utils.rs for extractors crate (pre-existing compile error). All tests pass: 1112 extractor tests + 712 lib tests.
