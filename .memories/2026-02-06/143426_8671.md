Completed full trace_call_path audit (Phase 3 Priority 4). Key findings: (1) Only queries symbols + relationships tables — identifiers table (1.2M records) and types table are completely ignored. (2) Cross-language callers/callees functions are functionally identical (no directional logic). (3) Relationship filtering only uses Calls+References (2 of 14 kinds). (4) Dead code: handler param never accessed in tracing.rs, similarity field always None (embedding remnant), duplicate cross-language functions, dead create_result params. (5) Estimated data utilization ~15-20%. Biggest wins: integrate identifiers table for call site discovery, expand relationship kind filtering, remove dead code.
