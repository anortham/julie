Phase 4 Documentation Cleanup COMPLETE. Removed all references to old CASCADE/FTS5/HNSW/ONNX/embeddings architecture from active docs and source. Deleted 6 skills (switching to superpowers-only), GPU_SETUP.md. Rewrote SEARCH_FLOW.md (332 lines of accurate Tantivy docs). Updated CLAUDE.md, README.md, INTELLIGENCE_LAYER.md, 5 smaller docs, TODO.md, 4 Rust source files. Fixed 2 build warnings (unused import/variable). 774 tests pass, 0 warnings, 0 stale refs in active files. Code Intelligence Audit all 4 phases now complete.
