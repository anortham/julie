Phase 2 (Tool Categorization) COMPLETE. All 15 Julie MCP tools categorized into 4 buckets:

Bucket A (Table-stakes, differentiated): fast_goto, fast_refs, rename_symbol — overlap with Claude Code's native LSP but differentiated by name-based lookup, 30 langs, cross-workspace, polyglot support.

Bucket B (Moat): fast_search, get_symbols, trace_call_path, fast_explore, checkpoint/recall/plan — LSP fundamentally can't do these.

Bucket C (Evaluate): find_logic (KILL — redirect to fast_explore), edit_lines/fuzzy_replace (investigate underuse).

Bucket D (Enhance): fast_refs (1.2M identifiers unused), fast_explore types (10% utilized), trace_call_path (no relationship filtering), fast_search (Tantivy fuzzy/phrase/doc unused).

Key finding: Data utilization is only ~35% — extractors produce rich data at 95% comprehensiveness but tools ignore 65% of it. Identifiers table is the single largest untapped resource.

Phase 3 priority order approved: (1) fast_search, (2) fast_refs + identifiers unlock, (3) get_symbols, (4) trace_call_path, (5) fast_explore, (6) fast_goto, (7) editing tools, (8) memory tools, (9) manage_workspace. Kill find_logic.

Competitive research: Claude Code ships native LSP (Dec 2025) but limited language support, unclear polyglot. Julie's moat is cross-language + codebase-wide + agent-native.
