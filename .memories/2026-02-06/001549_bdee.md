Completed brainstorming session for Code Intelligence Audit & Optimization. Designed 4-phase roadmap: (1) Data Pipeline Audit — automated census of 30 extractors + end-to-end trace for Rust/TypeScript/Python/Go + gap analysis, (2) Tool Categorization — bucket tools into table-stakes/moat/evaluate, (3) Tool Deep-Dives — one per session with 6-point checklist (data utilization, output optimization, semantic remnants, code quality, test coverage, dogfood), (4) Documentation Cleanup. Cross-cutting concerns: Tantivy as general-purpose resource beyond search, semantic remnant cleanup, Rust code quality, agent-first output. Key insight: Julie's moat is what LSPs CAN'T do — cross-language tracing, business logic discovery, architectural queries, agent-optimized output. Design doc committed to docs/plans/2026-02-05-code-intelligence-audit-design.md.
