Improved PendingRelationship resolution: extracted to resolver.rs module with scored disambiguation (language +100, same dir +50, parent dir +25, callable kind +10). Expanded kind filter from 3 to 14 SymbolKind variants. Added ResolutionStats with success rate logging. 14 unit tests. Wired into processor.rs replacing old .find()-based logic. 726 lib tests pass.
