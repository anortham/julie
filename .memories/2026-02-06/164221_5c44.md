Phase 3 Deep-Dives Round 2 COMPLETE — all 9 tasks done. (1) Killed find_logic MCP registration, redirecting to fast_explore mode=logic. (2) Integrated identifiers into logic mode Tier 4 — generates naming variants, batches get_identifiers_by_names_and_kind("call"), counts unique callers, applies ln(count)*0.03 boost. (3) Visibility-aware ranking: pub +0.1, private -0.15, protected -0.05. (4) Implemented fast_goto qualified name resolution — parse_qualified_name splits on last :: or ., queries child name, batch-fetches parents, filters by parent name match. (5) Enriched fast_goto output with parent_name and visibility — batch parent lookup, updated lean format to show "(kind, visibility)" and "in ParentName". Extracted duplicated sort closure to sort_definitions method. (6-8) Rewrote MCP descriptions for edit_lines, fuzzy_replace, edit_symbol, recall, checkpoint. (7) Expanded agent instructions with decision guidance for editing tools. (9) Dogfood tested — logic mode works, qualified names need server rebuild to verify live (unit tests pass). 774 tests pass, 0 failures.
