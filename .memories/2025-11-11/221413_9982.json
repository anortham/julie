  "description": "Updated explore-codebase and semantic-intelligence skills to use fast_explore instead of deprecated find_logic. Removed find_logic from allowed-tools, added comprehensive fast_explore documentation with all 3 modes (logic/similar/dependencies), updated all examples and workflow patterns, added performance timings for each mode. Skills now align with v1.7.0 tool suite. Commit: 53bee63, pushed to origin/main.",
