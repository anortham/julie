  "description": "Completed comprehensive audit of rename_symbol tool (8/15 tools). Tool rated EXCELLENT with 90% confidence - production-ready workspace-wide renaming with Julie integration. KEY FINDING: rename_symbol is the FIRST editing tool that CORRECTLY uses Julie's semantic search (via FastRefsTool). This contrasts with fuzzy_replace (text similarity/Levenshtein correct for typos) and edit_lines (positional operations correct for line numbers). Key findings: (1) Two-phase architecture (search via FastRefsTool → rename file-by-file) leverages CASCADE (exact → variants → semantic with 0.75 safety threshold), (2) Workspace-wide scope with comprehensive symbol discovery across all files, (3) Critical workflow guidance in description: \"Always use fast_refs BEFORE renaming\" establishes safe impact analysis workflow, (4) Conservative defaults (update_imports=false, update_comments=false) require opt-in for advanced features, (5) Partial failure handling reports per-file errors with actionable suggestions, (6) Semantic differentiation clearly explained: \"Unlike text search-and-replace, preserves code semantics and avoids strings/comments\", (7) Zero redundancy with other editing tools (rename_symbol=workspace semantic, fuzzy_replace=bulk patterns, edit_lines=surgical line ops, edit_symbol=file-specific AST). Architecture: DiffMatchPatch for precise text matching + EditingTransaction for atomic operations. Test coverage: 5 tests (basic rename, validation, dry_run, multiple files); opportunity to add import/comment update tests. Audit progress: 8/15 tools (53%), all 8 rated EXCELLENT or EXCEPTIONAL.",
