  "description": "Completed comprehensive audit of fast_refs tool (4/15 tools). Tool rated EXCEPTIONAL with 95% confidence - safety-critical tool with appropriately strong behavioral language. Key findings: (1) Reuses fast_goto's proven three-stage CASCADE (exact → variants → semantic) + adds relationship tracking layer for definition → references mapping, (2) Stricter 0.75 threshold (vs fast_goto's 0.7) shows sophisticated understanding that reference finding is safety-critical - false positive reference = broken refactoring, (3) Performance optimized from O(n) linear scan to O(k * log n) indexed batch query (line 309: get_relationships_to_symbols), (4) Strongest behavioral adoption language of all tools (\"CRITICAL\", \"you WILL break dependencies\", \"non-negotiable\") which is appropriate for safety-critical tool, (5) Smart defaults: include_definition=true shows complete impact before changes. Tool strengths: CASCADE reuse, relationship tracking, confidence sorting, separate counts, zero redundancy (inverse of fast_goto, complementary workflow). Engineering excellence: mutex poisoning recovery, spawn_blocking, smart truncation after sorting. No changes recommended. Next tool: consider trace_call_path (PRIORITY 3) or skip to lower-priority tools that might need work.",
