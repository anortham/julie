  "description": "Completed comprehensive audit of get_symbols tool (2/15 tools). Tool rated EXCELLENT with 90% confidence - production-ready with innovative Smart Read capability. Key findings: (1) Direct database lookup is optimal for file-specific queries - semantic search not needed for core operation, (2) Smart Read modes (structure/minimal/full) are brilliant design achieving 70-90% token savings - better than Serena's approach, (3) Strong behavioral adoption with imperative language and emotional stakes, (4) Minor opportunity: fuzzy target matching for partial symbol names (current substring match works but could be enhanced), (5) Smart suggestions when target not found would improve UX. Tool strengths: optimal defaults (max_depth=1, limit=50, mode=structure), token-efficient output with rich structured content, uniform file handling, zero redundancy with other tools. The three-mode Smart Read solves context waste problem elegantly. Architecture is clean with separation between lookup (primary.rs), filtering, body extraction, and formatting. Next tool: fast_goto (navigation).",
