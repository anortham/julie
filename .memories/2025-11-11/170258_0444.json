  "description": "AUDIT COMPLETE - All 14/14 Julie MCP tools audited with exceptional quality findings. MAJOR VALIDATION: Zero tools found with incorrect semantic search usage - CASCADE architecture design validated. Quality distribution: 3 EXCEPTIONAL (21%), 11 EXCELLENT (79%), average 89% confidence. Key findings: (1) Semantic search integration is CORRECT across all tools (fast tools skip semantic for speed, intelligent tools use semantic for concept expansion, user-controlled tools offer choice, admin tools trigger embeddings), (2) Clean architectural separation (admin/search/operations layers), (3) Excellent test coverage (12/14 tools), (4) Strong behavioral adoption language works, (5) No tool redundancy, complementary workflows. CRITICAL: find_logic needs tests (0% coverage for complex 5-tier system). Tools audited: fast_search (95%), get_symbols (90%), fast_goto (95% EXCEPTIONAL), fast_refs (95% EXCEPTIONAL), trace_call_path (95% EXCEPTIONAL), fuzzy_replace (90%), edit_lines (90%), rename_symbol (90%), edit_symbol (90%), checkpoint (90%), recall (90%), plan (90%), find_logic (75% - needs tests), manage_workspace (90%). Discovery: fast_explore listed but not implemented. Recommendation: Add tests for find_logic (Priority 1). Audit validates CASCADE architecture and tool suite quality is production-ready.",
