  "description": "Applied fast_search minor improvements from audit: (1) Reframed performance language to not make semantic sound slow (\"both are fast\"), (2) Added examples to search_method param (conceptual queries, memory searches), (3) Added .memories/ example to file_pattern with recall tool note. Also documented entry_points mode as future consideration (deferred pending usage data). All changes compile successfully.",
