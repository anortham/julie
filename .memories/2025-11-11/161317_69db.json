  "description": "Completed comprehensive audit of fast_goto tool (3/15 tools). Tool rated EXCEPTIONAL with 95% confidence - Julie's most sophisticated navigation tool. Key findings: (1) Three-stage CASCADE architecture is brilliant (exact → variants → semantic fallback), each stage progressively \"smarter\" but slightly slower, (2) Cross-language naming intelligence (Stage 2) is unique to Julie - handles camelCase ↔ snake_case transformations that no other tool provides, (3) INTENTIONALLY HARDCODED 0.7 threshold prevents agents from wasting 3+ tool calls iterating through thresholds - shows deep understanding of agent behavior (professional engineering), (4) Context-aware prioritization using context_file and line_number enables intelligent disambiguation, (5) Exceptional behavioral adoption with confidence-building language (\"You don't need exact symbol names!\"). Tool strengths: optimal strategy (fast → smart → semantic), graceful HNSW degradation, mutex poisoning recovery, token-efficient output, zero redundancy. No changes recommended - tool is architecturally mature. Innovation highlight: Three-stage CASCADE + cross-language intelligence is unique in the industry. Next tool: fast_refs (references tracking).",
