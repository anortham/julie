  "description": "Completed comprehensive audit of manage_workspace tool (14/15 tools). Tool rated EXCELLENT with 90% confidence - comprehensive administrative foundation with 8 operations. KEY FINDING: manage_workspace is pure administrative tool that correctly does NOT use semantic search, but TRIGGERS embedding generation during indexing (indirect integration). Key findings: (1) 8 comprehensive operations: index (run first!), add, remove, list, clean, refresh, stats, health, (2) Foundational positioning - enables ALL search tools (without index, search returns zero), (3) 35 tests covering administrative operations (8 mod_tests, 13 registry_service, 10 registry, 4 utils), (4) Excellent tool description with JSON examples for each operation, (5) Strong onboarding guidance (\"Always run 'index' operation first\"), (6) Clean separation: manage_workspace (admin layer) → indexing pipeline (data layer) → fast_search (query layer), (7) Workspace isolation (primary vs reference distinction), (8) Health diagnostics for troubleshooting, (9) Safe operations (remove doesn't delete physical files), (10) Regression test for Bug #1 (add workspace updates statistics). Architecture is CORRECT - administrative CRUD operations don't need search/embeddings, but trigger indexing pipeline which generates embeddings that become searchable via fast_search. Perfect foundational layer positioning. Audit progress: 14/15 tools (93%), all 14 rated EXCELLENT or EXCEPTIONAL. Only fast_explore remains.",
