  "description": "Completed comprehensive audit of trace_call_path tool (5/15 tools). Tool rated EXCEPTIONAL with 95% confidence - Julie's unique killer feature (cross-language call tracing). Key findings: (1) Three-strategy recursive tracing reuses proven CASCADE (direct → naming variants → semantic) + adds depth traversal for execution flow trees, (2) Cross-language depth limiting prevents explosion when languages bridge multiple times (brilliant engineering preventing JS → Python → Go → SQL loops), (3) Visited tracking with unique keys (file:line:name) prevents infinite loops, (4) Batch query optimization avoids N+1 pattern with get_symbols_by_ids(), (5) Dual output format (JSON for agents, tree for humans), (6) Strong uniqueness positioning (\"UNIQUE CAPABILITY - NO other tool can...\") correctly emphasizes Julie's differentiator. Tool strengths: unique cross-language capability, balanced 0.7 threshold for discovery (not safety-critical), bidirectional tracing (upstream/downstream/both), match type transparency (Direct/NamingVariant/Semantic), reference workspace support. Innovation: Cross-language call path tracing across TypeScript → Go → Python → SQL is unique in the industry. No changes recommended - tool is architecturally mature. Audit progress: 5/15 tools (33%), all 5 rated EXCELLENT or EXCEPTIONAL.",
