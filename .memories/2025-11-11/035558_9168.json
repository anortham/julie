  "description": "Added JSONC (JSON with Comments) support as language #32. Zero new dependencies - reused existing tree-sitter-json v0.24.8 parser which already handles JavaScript-style comments. Changed 3 files (language.rs, watcher/filtering.rs, utils/mod.rs) to add .jsonc extension mapping. Added 4 comprehensive tests covering line comments, block comments, mixed comments, and real-world tsconfig.json files. All 34 JSON extractor tests passing. Enables indexing of VSCode config files like tsconfig.json and settings.json with comments.",
