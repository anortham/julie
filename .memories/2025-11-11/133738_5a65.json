  "description": "Completed Phase 2 implementation: Custom memory embeddings for RAG optimization. Implemented build_memory_embedding_text() with focused \"{type}: {description}\" format. Added 5 comprehensive tests covering checkpoint/decision types, non-description symbol skipping, mutable plan exclusion, missing type fallback, and standard code unchanged. All tests passing. Ready for reindexing to generate new embeddings.",
