  "description": "Completed comprehensive audit of edit_lines tool (7/15 tools). Tool rated EXCELLENT with 90% confidence - production-ready surgical editing tool. Key findings: (1) Direct line number operations correctly don't use semantic search (positional operations vs conceptual queries are different), (2) Three clear operations (insert/replace/delete) with comprehensive validation (24 tests), (3) Safe-by-default design with dry_run=true prevents accidental modifications, (4) Atomic operations via EditingTransaction ensure consistency, (5) Cross-platform line ending preservation (auto-detects CRLF vs LF), (6) Security tested (path traversal prevention, symlinks), (7) Zero redundancy with other editing tools (edit_lines for surgical precision by line number, fuzzy_replace for bulk patterns, rename_symbol for semantic renaming, edit_symbol for AST-aware operations). Tool strengths: 1-indexed line numbers (matches editors), operation-specific validation (insert requires content, replace/delete require end_line), atomic operations (temp file + rename), clean architecture (validate → perform → transact). Test coverage: 11 functional tests (insert/delete/replace/dry_run/paths), 13 validation tests (missing params/invalid ranges/boundaries), security tests (absolute paths/relative traversal/symlinks), edge cases (CRLF/empty files/EOF). No changes recommended - tool is production-ready with excellent complementary positioning in editing toolset. Audit progress: 7/15 tools (47%), all 7 rated EXCELLENT or EXCEPTIONAL.",
