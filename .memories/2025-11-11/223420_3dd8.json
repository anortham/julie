  "description": "Fixed DirectML GPU crash under memory pressure - reduced batch sizing from (VRAM/6)*50 to (VRAM/6)*30 for 40% safety margin. 6GB A1000 at 97.6% utilization was crashing with batch_size=50 (55s batch time + DirectML error 887A0006). Now uses batch_size=30 for stable operation. Comprehensive test suite added in src/tests/embedding_batch_sizing_tests.rs. No performance penalty on compute-bound workloads.",
