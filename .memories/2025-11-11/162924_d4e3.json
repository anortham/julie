  "description": "Completed comprehensive audit of fuzzy_replace tool (6/15 tools). Tool rated EXCELLENT with 90% confidence - production-ready editing tool with no improvements needed. Key findings: (1) DMP + Levenshtein hybrid approach optimal for fuzzy string matching (fast candidate finding + precise filtering), (2) Text-based editing correctly doesn't use semantic search (character-level pattern matching vs conceptual similarity are different operations), (3) Safe-by-default design with dry_run=true prevents accidental destructive operations, (4) Multi-file capability with glob patterns enables bulk refactoring, (5) Atomic operations via EditingTransaction (temp file + rename) prevent partial failures, (6) Comprehensive test coverage (43 tests covering similarity calculation, fuzzy matching, multi-file, security, edge cases), (7) Strong behavioral adoption (\"BULK PATTERN REPLACEMENT\", \"You are EXCELLENT\", workflow guidance), (8) Zero redundancy with other editing tools (complementary positioning: fuzzy_replace for bulk typo-tolerant patterns, edit_lines for surgical line edits, rename_symbol for semantic renaming, edit_symbol for AST-aware operations). Tool strengths: optimal defaults (threshold=0.8, distance=1000, dry_run=true, validate=true), security-first design (path traversal prevention tested), performance optimization (O(N) string slicing not O(N²)), clean architecture (call_tool → single/multi → fuzzy_search_replace). No changes recommended - tool is production-ready and well-designed. Audit progress: 6/15 tools (40%), all 6 rated EXCELLENT or EXCEPTIONAL.",
