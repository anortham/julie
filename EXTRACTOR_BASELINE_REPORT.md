## 🧪 Test Distribution Analysis

### Top 10 Test Coverage by Count
| Language | Test Count | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Python | 116 | ✅ Comprehensive |
| TypeScript | 98 | ✅ Strong |
| Regex | 76 | ⚠️ Good tests, poor coverage (54.5%) |
| Lua | 72 | ⚠️ Good tests, poor coverage (69.1%) |
| C++ | 72 | ✅ Excellent (94.8% coverage) |
| Rust | 71 | ✅ Excellent (97.6% coverage) |
| Go | 64 | ✅ Strong (84.5% coverage) |
| Java | 60 | 🔴 Good tests, CRITICAL coverage (52%) |
| C# | 60 | ✅ Strong (88.5% coverage) |
| Vue | 58 | ✅ Strong (80.8% coverage) |

### Bottom 10 Test Coverage by Count
| Language | Test Count | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| GDScript | 32 | ⚠️ Low tests, but 82.2% coverage |
| Swift | 38 | ⚠️ Low tests, 75.4% coverage |
| JavaScript | 38 | ⚠️ Low tests, but 95.5% coverage! |
| Kotlin | 38 | ⚠️ Low tests, but 89.9% coverage |
| Razor | 36 | ⚠️ Low tests, 78.1% coverage |
| Bash | 40 | ⚠️ Low tests, 76.4% coverage |
| Zig | 40 | ⚠️ Low tests, 79.9% coverage |
| Dart | 42 | ⚠️ Low tests, but 85.6% coverage |
| CSS | 44 | ⚠️ Low tests, but 96.9% coverage! |
| PowerShell | 46 | ⚠️ Low tests, 70% coverage |

**Key Insight**: Some languages (JavaScript, CSS) achieve high coverage with fewer tests (quality over quantity), while others (Regex, Lua, Java) have many tests but poor coverage (missing edge cases or dead code).

## 🚨 Code Quality Audit

### Unwrap Calls Analysis
- **Total unwrap calls**: 181 (across 40 files)
- **Target**: <50 (only in safe contexts)
- **Action needed**: Audit each unwrap for safety, convert unsafe ones to proper error handling

### TODO/FIXME Markers
- **Total**: 0 ✅
- **Status**: Clean codebase, no technical debt markers

### File Organization
- **25 language extractors** (all operational)
- **25 test directories** (matching 1:1 with extractors)
- **Comprehensive structure** with symbols, identifiers, relationships sub-modules

## 📋 Recommended Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Validate Excellence (1-2 days)
**Target**: Ensure our best extractors are truly production-ready

Audit these 5 extractors (90%+ coverage):
1. ✅ Rust (97.6%) - Our dogfooding language
2. ✅ CSS (96.9%) - Web styling
3. ✅ JavaScript (95.5%) - Core web language
4. ✅ PHP (94.9%) - Popular backend
5. ✅ C++ (94.8%) - Systems programming

**Per extractor**:
- Run coverage, identify uncovered lines
- Manual code review
- Check all `.unwrap()` calls for safety
- Verify all language features extracted
- Add missing edge case tests
- Document findings in `AUDIT.md`

### Phase 2: Strengthen Core (2-3 days)
**Target**: Bring 80-90% extractors to 90%+ coverage

Languages: Vue, GDScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Dart, C, C#, Kotlin (9 extractors)

### Phase 3: Fix Critical Gaps (2-3 days)
**Target**: Address low-coverage extractors (<70%)

**CRITICAL PRIORITY**:
1. 🔴 **Java** (52.0%) - Enterprise language, needs urgent attention
2. 🔴 **Regex** (54.5%) - Complex patterns, edge cases missing
3. 🟡 **Lua** (69.1%) - Just below threshold
4. 🟡 **SQL** (69.7%) - Database queries essential

### Phase 4: Mid-Tier Improvement (1-2 days)
**Target**: Bring 70-80% extractors to ≥80%

Languages: PowerShell, Ruby, HTML, Swift, Bash, Razor, Zig (7 extractors)

## 🛠️ Next Actions

1. ✅ **Baseline metrics gathered** (this report)
2. **Start Phase 1** - Audit Rust extractor (highest coverage, our dogfooding language)
3. **Per-extractor workflow**:
   - Run: `cargo tarpaulin --include-files 'src/extractors/rust/*' -o Html`
   - Review uncovered lines in HTML report
   - Manual code review using quality checklist
   - Document findings in `src/extractors/rust/AUDIT.md`
   - Add missing tests to reach 100% coverage goal
4. **Iterate** - Refine process based on first audit, then continue with remaining Phase 1 extractors
