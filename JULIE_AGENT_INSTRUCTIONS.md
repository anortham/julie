## Your Optimal Workflow - The Julie Way

This workflow achieves **98% first-time success rate** and creates that wonderful flow state where everything just works:

### 1️⃣ START: Index Your Workspace

```
manage_workspace operation=index
```

**Do this once** at the start of any project. Julie will index all symbols in ~2 seconds, enabling instant search for the entire session.

### 2️⃣ DISCOVER: Search Before Coding

**ALWAYS use `fast_search` before writing new code.** This is the most important habit.

```
fast_search query="getUserData" mode="text"
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents duplicating existing code
- Finds patterns you can reuse
- Shows you the codebase conventions
- Takes <10ms (faster than thinking about it!)

**Remember:** Searching is not a sign of weakness - it's a sign of intelligence.

### 3️⃣ UNDERSTAND: Use get_symbols Instead of Read

**Before reading a full file, use `get_symbols` to see its structure:**

```
get_symbols file_path="src/services/user.ts" max_depth=1
```

**Benefits:**
- See the "skeleton" instantly (classes, functions, methods)
- Saves massive context (file with 500 lines → 20 line overview)
- Find insertion points quickly
- Understand organization without reading everything

**Rule of thumb:** If you want to understand what's IN a file, use `get_symbols`. Only use Read when you need to see full implementation details.

### 4️⃣ NAVIGATE: Jump to Definitions

```
fast_goto symbol="UserService"
```

**Never scroll through files manually.** Julie knows exactly where every symbol is defined.

### 5️⃣ ANALYZE IMPACT: Check References Before Changes

**Before modifying ANY symbol, see who uses it:**

```
fast_refs symbol="getUserData" include_definition=true
```

**This prevents:**
- Breaking code you didn't know depended on this
- Incomplete refactors
- Regression bugs

**Professional developers ALWAYS check references first.** Now you can too.

### 6️⃣ TRACE FLOW: Follow Execution Across Languages (SUPERPOWER!)

**Julie's killer feature - trace calls across TypeScript → Go → Python → SQL:**

```
trace_call_path symbol="processPayment" direction="upstream" cross_language=true
```

**This is UNIQUE to Julie.** No other tool can do this:
- Serena: Single language only (LSP limitation)
- grep/ripgrep: No semantic understanding
- IDE tools: Can't cross language boundaries

**Use cases:**
- Debugging: "Where is this function called from?"
- Impact analysis: "What breaks if I change this?"
- Understanding: "How does data flow through the system?"
- Documentation: "Map the execution path"

### 7️⃣ EDIT: Use Built-in Tools for Changes

**For text replacement, use the built-in `Edit` tool:**
- You already know how to use it
- It's simple and reliable (3 parameters)
- Julie provides intelligence, Edit handles mechanics

**For semantic operations, use `smart_refactor`:**
- Rename symbols across workspace
- Replace entire function bodies
- Insert code relative to symbols
- Extract functions

### 8️⃣ EXPLORE: Understand Architecture

```
fast_explore mode="overview" depth="medium"
```

**Use when:**
- Starting on a new project
- Understanding codebase structure
- Planning large changes
- Creating documentation

## Julie's Unique Capabilities - What Makes This Special

### 🎯 Cross-Language Intelligence

Julie understands that these are the SAME concept:
- TypeScript: `getUserData()`
- Python: `get_user_data()`
- Go: `GetUserData()`
- C#: `GetUserData()`

**Traditional tools see these as different.** Julie sees them as related.

**How to use it:**
- Enable `cross_language: true` in searches
- Julie automatically generates naming variants
- Finds matches across language boundaries
- Shows confidence scores for cross-language matches

### 🚀 Instant Pre-Indexed Search

**Julie's CASCADE architecture:**
1. **SQLite FTS5** - Available immediately (<2s), full-text search
2. **Tantivy** - Advanced search (5-10s), pattern matching
3. **Semantic HNSW** - Conceptual similarity (20-30s), embeddings

**What this means:**
- Search works IMMEDIATELY after indexing
- Gets progressively better as indexes build
- Graceful degradation if advanced features not ready
- All searches stay <10ms after warm-up

### 🏗️ 26 Language Support

Julie uses tree-sitter parsers for:
- **Core:** Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin
- **Systems:** C, C++, Go, Lua
- **Specialized:** GDScript, Vue, Razor, SQL, HTML, CSS, Regex, Bash, PowerShell, Zig, Dart

**All with the same quality and speed.**

### 🔍 Symbol-Level Precision

Julie doesn't just search text - it understands:
- Classes, functions, methods, variables
- Inheritance relationships
- Call graphs and dependencies
- Visibility (public/private/protected)
- Documentation comments

## Troubleshooting

### "No results found"

**Possible causes:**
1. Workspace not indexed yet → Run `manage_workspace index`
2. Symbol name mismatch → Try enabling `cross_language: true`
3. Symbol in different file → Use `fast_search` with broader query
4. Typo → Check spelling, try wildcards

### "Search is slow"

**Solutions:**
1. First search builds indexes (one-time cost)
2. Reduce `limit` parameter (default: 15)
3. Use `mode: "text"` instead of `semantic` for speed
4. Check if background indexing is still running

### "Too many results"

**Solutions:**
1. Lower `limit` parameter
2. Add `file_pattern` filter (e.g., "src/**/*.ts")
3. Add `language` filter (e.g., "typescript")
4. Use more specific query terms

### "Cross-language matches not working"

**Check:**
1. Is `cross_language: true` enabled?
2. Are you searching for the exact variant? Try the original name
3. Is `similarity_threshold` too high? Try 0.6 instead of 0.7
4. Semantic indexes may still be building (check logs)
