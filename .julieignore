# Julie Ignore File
# ==================
# Add patterns for files/directories you don't want indexed by Julie
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
#
# Pattern Types:
#   - Directory patterns (end with /): matches anywhere in path
#     Example: wwwroot/lib/
#
#   - Extension patterns (start with *.): matches file extensions
#     Example: *.min.js
#
#   - Substring patterns: matches anywhere in the path
#     Example: font-awesome
#
# Note: Julie already excludes common directories by default:
#   - node_modules/, vendor/, bower_components/, .npm/
#   - bin/, obj/, build/, dist/, out/, target/
#   - .git/, .svn/, .vscode/, .idea/
#   - TestResults/, coverage/, __pycache__/
#   - And many more (see src/tools/shared.rs for full list)

# ============================================================
# EXAMPLES - Uncomment and modify as needed for your project
# ============================================================

# Vendor libraries (if not already covered by defaults)
# wwwroot/lib/
# vendor/custom-framework/
# third-party/

# Generated files
# *.generated.cs
# *.designer.cs
# *.g.i.cs
# *.min.js
# *.min.css
# *.bundle.js

# Large data files
# data/
# datasets/
# *.json (only if you have huge JSON data files - be careful!)

# Test fixtures (if you don't want them indexed)
# fixtures/large-files/
# test-data/sample-datasets/

# Documentation that clutters search results
# docs/vendor/
# api-docs/generated/
# .storybook/

# Specific libraries causing noise in search
# font-awesome/
# popper.js/
# bootstrap/

# Project-specific exclusions
# Add your custom patterns below:

# Test fixtures - exclude from indexing and embeddings
# (test data has no semantic value for agent assistance)
