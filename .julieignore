# Julie Ignore File
# ==================
# Add patterns for files/directories you don't want indexed by Julie
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
#
# Pattern Types:
#   - Directory patterns (end with /): matches anywhere in path
#     Example: wwwroot/lib/
#
#   - Extension patterns (start with *.): matches file extensions
#     Example: *.min.js
#
#   - Substring patterns: matches anywhere in the path
#     Example: font-awesome
#
# Note: Julie already excludes common directories by default:
#   - node_modules/, vendor/, bower_components/, .npm/
#   - bin/, obj/, build/, dist/, out/, target/
#   - .git/, .svn/, .vscode/, .idea/
#   - TestResults/, coverage/, __pycache__/
#   - And many more (see src/tools/shared.rs for full list)
