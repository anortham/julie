* no build warnings! clean them up!
* no tests should be filtered or skipped or commented out!
* we should have 100% passing tests
* miller had real world tests that read real world code files to test against, we should have that in Julie too
* We need to examine codesearch and the coa mcp framework for tips on token optimization and search result optimization
* we also need to look at codesearch and look at the way it successfully implements server instructions and tool descriptions to drive adoption
* we should also look at how codesearch returns context lines in searches to help give context for the agent to make the appropriate selection from a result set
* we use diffmatchpatch in codesearch for editing and it works great, we should use that in julie too
* we need to discuss what tools we expose and what they are named. I have some confusion about the current setup
