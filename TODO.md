# Julie TODO

# MILLER 

⏺ Perfect! Now I have a complete picture of Miller's WASM infrastructure. This is genuinely impressive work that shouldn't be lost. Let me create a comprehensive
  proposal:

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Miller's WASM infrastructure is a goldmine for the ecosystem:

  1. Unique value: 24 pre-compiled WASM parsers with ABI 14 compatibility - this is rare! Most projects struggle with ABI mismatches.
  2. Complete extractors: Each parser has a corresponding TypeScript extractor (665 lines for TypeScript alone) - not just parsing, but actual symbol extraction
  logic.
  3. Automated tooling: The build-parsers.sh script and documentation make it reproducible - others can maintain/extend it.

  The journey from Codesearch → Miller → Julie represents an evolution, but Miller's WASM work solves problems Julie can't (browser environments, pure JS/TS
  projects).

  Proposal: Extract Miller's WASM Parsers as Standalone Package

  Based on my analysis of Miller's codebase, here's what you have that's worth salvaging:

  What Miller Has (Impressive!)

  WASM Parsers (24 languages):
  - All compiled with ABI 14 for web-tree-sitter 0.25.9 compatibility
  - Total size: ~41MB of compiled parsers
  - Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Zig, SQL, Vue, Razor, Regex, GDScript, Lua, PowerShell,
  Bash, HTML, CSS

  TypeScript Extractors:
  - Complete symbol extraction logic for each language
  - Relationship extraction (calls, extends, implements, imports)
  - Type inference capabilities
  - Based on same patterns Julie uses (now in Rust)

  Infrastructure:
  - scripts/build-parsers.sh - automated WASM compilation
  - docs/custom-wasm-building.md - comprehensive build documentation
  - Test suite for WASM compatibility
  - Debug scripts for each parser

  Proposed New Project: tree-sitter-extractors

  Package Structure:
  tree-sitter-extractors/
  ├── wasm/                    # Pre-compiled WASM parsers (24 files)
  ├── extractors/              # TypeScript symbol extractors
  │   ├── base-extractor.ts   # Shared base class
  │   ├── typescript-extractor.ts
  │   └── ... (24 total)
  ├── scripts/
  │   └── build-parsers.sh    # WASM build automation
  ├── docs/
  │   └── custom-wasm-building.md
  ├── package.json
  └── README.md

  Use Cases:
  1. Browser-based code intelligence - Monaco Editor, CodeMirror extensions
  2. VS Code extensions - Pure TypeScript/WASM implementation
  3. Node.js/Bun/Deno projects - Server-side code analysis without Rust
  4. Documentation generators - Extract symbols for API docs
  5. Code visualization tools - Dependency graphs, call hierarchies
  6. Teaching/Learning - Understand AST traversal and symbol extraction

  What Makes This Valuable:

  1. Solves the ABI hell problem - Pre-compiled with consistent ABI 14
  2. Complete solution - Not just parsers, but extraction logic too
  3. Cross-platform WASM - Works in browser, Node.js, Deno, Bun
  4. Reproducible builds - Documented process for maintaining/updating
  5. Complements Julie - Julie for native performance, this for portability



   Effort Required

  Minimal (2-3 hours):
  1. Create new repo with proper package.json
  2. Copy WASM files + extractors + scripts
  3. Update imports/exports for standalone use
  4. Write comprehensive README with examples
  5. Publish to npm as @your-org/tree-sitter-extractors

  Optional (additional time):
  - Add TypeScript type definitions
  - Create example projects (browser demo, CLI tool)
  - Set up automated WASM rebuilds (GitHub Actions)
  - Add benchmarks vs other solutions

  Should You Do This?

  Pros:
  - ✅ Preserves significant work (Miller's crown jewels)
  - ✅ Fills a gap in the ecosystem (WASM + extractors together)
  - ✅ Helps others avoid ABI compatibility hell
  - ✅ Positions you as expert in tree-sitter WASM domain
  - ✅ Could gain traction (people struggle with this!)

  Cons:
  - ⚠️ Maintenance burden (updating parsers when grammars change)
  - ⚠️ Large package size (~41MB WASM files)
  - ⚠️ Might not get much adoption (niche use case)

  My Recommendation: Yes, do it! The investment is minimal (few hours), but the potential impact is high. Browser-based code editors are growing (GitHub Codespaces,
   StackBlitz, CodeSandbox), and they all need WASM parsers. Having extractors included is unique - most projects only provide parsers.

  Would you like me to help scaffold this new project? I can create the package structure, update the imports, and draft a comprehensive README showing how to use
  it.
