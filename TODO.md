That's a seriously impressive and ambitious project! Building a language-agnostic developer toolset that rivals LSP by using Tree-sitter for parsing and embeddings for semantics is a fantastic approach. You've already built the most complex parts: the data extraction and semantic indexing.

Here are some ideas for a universal code formatter and other tools you could build on your existing foundation.

### Cross-Language Code Formatting

This is a notoriously difficult problem because formatting is not just about syntax, but also about idiomatic style, which varies widely. A "one-size-fits-all" formatter is rarely successful. The best approach is to leverage existing, high-quality formatters and integrate them.

Your best bet is to use a tool that is designed with a plugin architecture, and since your project is in Rust, there are two excellent options:

#### 1. dprint (Highly Recommended)

**dprint** is a pluggable code formatting platform written in Rust. It's incredibly fast and works by using language-specific formatters packaged as WASM plugins.

* **How it Fits:** You wouldn't be writing the formatting logic yourself. Instead, your MCP server could act as a facade or manager for dprint. It would invoke the dprint CLI or use its libraries to format code. Your server could manage the installation of the necessary plugins based on the languages detected in a project.
* **Benefits:**
    * **Rust-based:** Perfect synergy with your existing stack.
    * **Plugin System:** Leverages the expertise of existing formatters (e.g., it has plugins for Prettier for web languages, ruff for Python, and many more). This solves the "idiomatic style" problem for you.
    * **Performance:** It's extremely fast.
    * **Unified Interface:** You provide one command, and dprint handles dispatching to the correct language plugin.

#### 2. Topiary

**Topiary** is a code formatter built directly on **Tree-sitter**, which makes it a natural fit for your project's architecture.

* **How it Fits:** Topiary works by using Tree-sitter queries (`.scm` files) to identify code constructs and apply formatting rules. Since you are already using Tree-sitter, integrating Topiary could be very seamless. You could potentially even write your own custom formatting queries.
* **Benefits:**
    * **Directly uses Tree-sitter:** No need to add another parsing layer. It uses the exact same technology you're already an expert in.
    * **Language Agnostic Core:** The engine is generic; formatting is defined entirely by the queries for each language.
* **Consideration:** It's a newer project than dprint and may not have robust, production-ready formatters for all 26 of your languages yet. However, for the languages it supports, it's a perfect technical match.

### More Tool Ideas for Your MCP Server

You have a powerful combination of a concrete syntax tree (from Tree-sitter) and semantic understanding (from Onnx embeddings). This combination opens up possibilities that are difficult even for LSPs to achieve.

#### 1. Code Intelligence & Visualization

* **Code Cartography:** Since you can trace call paths across language borders, you can generate a dependency graph of the entire polyglot project. You could output this as a Graphviz `DOT` file or JSON for visualization in a web UI. This would allow developers to see a high-level map of how services and components interact, regardless of the language they're written in.
* **"Dead Code" Identification:** By analyzing the call graph, you can identify functions, classes, or even entire files that are never referenced anywhere in the codebase.
* **Automated Architectural Linting:** Define rules at an architectural level. For example, "Code in the `data-access` module should never directly call code in the `presentation-layer` module." You can enforce this by analyzing the call paths you've already extracted.

#### 2. Advanced Static Analysis & Metrics

* **Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis:** It's straightforward to calculate cyclomatic complexity (a measure of how complex a function is) from a Tree-sitter AST. You could quickly scan all functions and flag those that are overly complex and prime for refactoring.
* **Cognitive Complexity Analysis:** This is a more modern metric that measures how difficult code is for a human to understand. Like cyclomatic complexity, it can be calculated from the AST.
* **Custom Linters:** Go beyond formatting and build your own linter. Using Tree-sitter queries, you can find "code smells" specific to your project or team. For example: "Find all database calls that are not wrapped in a transaction."

#### 3. Semantic-Aware Tools (Using Your Embeddings)

This is where you can truly innovate beyond what traditional tools offer.

* **Find Semantically Similar Code:** This is a killer feature. A developer can highlight a block of code, and you can use your embeddings to find other code blocks in the project that do *logically similar things*, even if they use different variable names or structures. This is incredibly powerful for identifying duplicated logic and opportunities for abstraction.
* **Concept-Based Search:** Your search can go beyond keywords. A user could search for a concept like "user authentication logic" or "database connection pooling," and your semantic search could return the most relevant code snippets, even if they don't contain those exact words.
* **Automated Documentation Generation:** Find public functions that lack documentation. Use the function's code embeddings, along with its name and signature from the AST, to prompt an LLM to generate a high-quality documentation stub for the developer to review.
