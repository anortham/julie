# TODO

## Plan tool

We need to revisit this tool and see if it needs work. Claude code plan mode has improved, skills like superpowers provide plans, but not everyone will use Julie in claude code.

## Tool promotion

deep_dive doesn't seem to be getting called enough. We need to look at the tool description and the server instructions and make sure we are promoting that tool properly and using the correct behavioral adoption language.

## Build warnings

Fix all build warnings — ALWAYS keep the build clean.

## Filewatcher validation

Validate that the filewatcher is keeping the index fresh since we made all the changes with adding tantivy and removing the embeddings pipeline.
