* (lowest priority) we still need to figure out adding support for qmljs https://github.com/yuja/tree-sitter-qmljs
* we need better test coverage, I think we proved that tonight!
* we need multiple performance reviews
* we have fast_edit and line_edit. to me that's a bit confusing, we should revisit how those 2 tools are designed
* I just saw the cache directory get created in the root of a project instead of in the .julie project. We gotta fix that.
