# TODO - Julie Development Tasks

## Current Active Development

_(Empty - ready for new tasks)_

---

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding automatic FTS health checks on startup
2. Add defensive checks to detect orphaned FTS rows and NULL content
3. Better error messages when snippet() fails (detect NULL content, suggest re-index)
4. Investigate incremental indexing NULL content issue - why do some updates set content to NULL?
