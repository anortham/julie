## Recently Fixed Issues

### ‚úÖ FIXED: FTS5 Corruption During Dogfooding (2025-10-28)

**Symptom:**
```
Error: fts5: missing row N from content table 'main'.'files'
Error: fts5: missing row N from content table 'main'.'symbols'
```

**Root Cause Discovered:**
Julie uses **FTS5 external content tables** where actual data lives in `files` and `symbols` tables, while FTS5 maintains separate shadow tables for search indexing. When DELETE occurs on the content table:
1. SQLite trigger fires: `DELETE FROM *_fts WHERE rowid = old.rowid`
2. This removes the rowid **mapping** but FTS5 shadow tables **KEEP the indexed content**
3. Orphaned content remains searchable, causing "missing row" errors when FTS5 tries to retrieve deleted rows

**The Fix (3 Missing rebuild_fts() Calls):**

**File 1:** `src/database/symbols/storage.rs`
- ‚úÖ `delete_symbols_for_file()` - Added `rebuild_symbols_fts()` call (line 138)
- ‚úÖ `delete_symbols_for_file_in_workspace()` - Added `rebuild_symbols_fts()` call (line 152)

**File 2:** `src/database/workspace.rs`
- ‚úÖ `delete_workspace_data()` - Added `rebuild_symbols_fts()` call (line 33, already had `rebuild_files_fts()`)

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ New reproduction test: `src/tests/integration/fts5_rowid_corruption.rs` (262 lines)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive TDD methodology: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR
- ‚úÖ Test validates the fix by reproducing corruption, applying fix, verifying resolution

**Validation Results (2025-10-28):**
- ‚úÖ Fresh database rebuild with fix applied
- ‚úÖ Text search working (single & multi-word queries)
- ‚úÖ Symbol navigation (`fast_goto`) working
- ‚úÖ Reference finding (`fast_refs`) working
- ‚úÖ Semantic search working (after embeddings completed in 148.87s)
- ‚úÖ HNSW index built successfully (8407 vectors indexed in 0.88s)
- ‚úÖ Zero FTS5 corruption errors in all operations

**Key Insight:**
The corruption we saw during validation was **legacy corruption** from before the fix. The fix prevents NEW corruption but doesn't auto-repair existing damage. Once database was rebuilt with fix in place, all operations work perfectly.

**Confidence Level:** 95% ‚Üí Will increase to 99% after 7 days of production monitoring without recurrence.

**Agent Credit:** Fixed by `sqlite-fts5-tdd-expert` agent following comprehensive 7-phase plan created by `Plan` agent.

## Observations & Insights

### ‚òÖ Relative Path Storage is Working
The core functionality is solid:
- Database correctly stores relative Unix-style paths ‚úÖ
- File processing converts absolute ‚Üí relative correctly ‚úÖ
- `create_file_info` properly handles both absolute and relative inputs ‚úÖ
- Orphan cleanup compares paths correctly in test scenarios ‚úÖ
- **But:** Edge cases still exist in production (FTS5 corruption)

### ‚òÖ Test Coverage Gap Identified
- All 1178 tests pass ‚úÖ
- **BUT:** FTS5 corruption occurs during normal dogfooding ‚ùå
- Suggests test suite doesn't cover all real-world scenarios
- Need stress tests for concurrent operations and file system events

## Next Actions

### Immediate Priority (Monitoring Phase)
1. **7-Day Production Monitoring** - Use Julie normally during development, monitor for any FTS5 errors
   - ‚úÖ Day 1: Fresh database validated, all search operations working
   - ‚è≥ Days 2-7: Monitor logs daily, use Julie for code search/navigation
2. **Daily Health Checks** - Quick verification that searches work without errors
3. **Log Review** - Check `.julie/logs/julie.log.*` for any FTS5-related warnings

### Medium Priority
4. **Fix Reference Workspace Test Failures** - 2 tests failing (unrelated to FTS5 fix)
   - `test_reference_workspace_end_to_end` (filesystem issues)
   - `test_reference_workspace_orphan_cleanup` (filesystem issues)
5. **Test Concurrent Mode** - Verify concurrent test execution (previously had 14 failures due to fixture contention)
6. **CI/CD Improvements** - Consider sequential mode for CI to avoid fixture contention

### Low Priority
7. **Documentation** - Update architecture docs with FTS5 corruption lessons learned
8. **Performance Testing** - Benchmark impact of additional `rebuild_fts()` calls

## Validation Checklist (7-Day Monitoring)

**Daily (Days 1-7):**
- [ ] Day 1: ‚úÖ Initial validation complete (all search operations working)
- [ ] Day 2: Use Julie for normal code search, check logs
- [ ] Day 3: Stress test (branch switching, refactoring, file operations)
- [ ] Day 4: Normal usage, monitor logs
- [ ] Day 5: Edge cases (rapid saves, bulk deletes)
- [ ] Day 6: Normal usage, monitor logs
- [ ] Day 7: Final validation - run full test suite, check integrity manually

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero "missing row" FTS5 errors during 7 days
- All search operations return results without errors
- Clean logs (no corruption warnings)
- Manual integrity checks return 0 orphaned rowids

**If Successful:** Confidence ‚Üí 99%, close monitoring phase, document as production-stable fix

---

## Quick Reference: Manual Health Checks

**Daily Health Check (30 seconds):**
```bash
# Just use Julie's search in your normal workflow
# Any FTS5 error = immediate investigation needed
```

**If Suspicious - Manual Integrity Check:**
```bash
# Check files table integrity (should return 0)
sqlite3 .julie/indexes/julie_*/db/symbols.db "
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files_fts_data
  WHERE rowid NOT IN (SELECT rowid FROM files)
"

# Check symbols table integrity (should return 0)
sqlite3 .julie/indexes/julie_*/db/symbols.db "
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM symbols_fts_data
  WHERE rowid NOT IN (SELECT rowid FROM symbols)
"
```

**If Corruption Recurs (Diagnostics):**
```bash
# 1. Save corrupted database for analysis
cp -r .julie/indexes/julie_* /tmp/corrupted-db-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# 2. Identify which table is corrupted
sqlite3 .julie/indexes/julie_*/db/symbols.db "
  SELECT 'files' as table_name, COUNT(*) as orphaned_rows
  FROM files_fts_data WHERE rowid NOT IN (SELECT rowid FROM files)
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'symbols', COUNT(*)
  FROM symbols_fts_data WHERE rowid NOT IN (SELECT rowid FROM symbols)
"

# 3. Check recent operations in logs
tail -100 .julie/logs/julie.log.$(date +%Y-%m-%d) | grep -i "delete\|orphan\|fts5"

# 4. Recover by rebuilding
rm -rf .julie/indexes/julie_*
# Restart Julie or trigger re-index
```

You're hitting the exact same library mismatch problem as on Windows, just with Linux's shared object (`.so`) files instead of (`.dll`) files.

The `ort` crate, by default, downloads a pre-built `libonnxruntime.so` binary. This binary was compiled by Microsoft and is linked against a *specific* CUDA toolkit, most likely **CUDA 11.x or 12.x**.

Your Linux system (Fedora/openSUSE) likely has a newer **CUDA 13** installed via its package manager. When your Rust app tries to load the pre-built `libonnxruntime.so`, the Linux dynamic linker (`ld`) sees that it needs, for example, `libcublas.so.12`, but it only finds `libcublas.so.13` on your system, and the process fails.

You have two main ways to fix this. Solution 2 is the more robust, "Linux-native" way, but Solution 1 is faster if you just want to get it working.

-----

### Solution 1: The Quick Fix (Install CUDA 12 Side-by-Side)

This is the same logic as our Windows fix. You install the older CUDA toolkit that the pre-built `ort` binary expects, and you use an environment variable to tell your app to use it.

1.  **Download CUDA 12 Toolkit:**

      * Go to the **[NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)**.
      * Find a CUDA 12.x version (e.g., 12.4.1).
      * Select your Linux distribution and choose the **`runfile (local)`** installer type. This is important as it's self-contained and won't conflict with your package manager.

2.  **Install the Toolkit (Driver-less):**

      * Run the installer with `sudo`: `sudo sh cuda_12.4.1_..._linux.run`
      * When the text-based installer appears, **you must deselect the Driver**. Press space on the "Driver" option to uncheck it. Your existing CUDA 13 driver is newer and backward-compatible.
      * Accept the defaults to install the toolkit to a versioned folder, like `/usr/local/cuda-12.4`.

3.  **Install Matching cuDNN:**

      * Go to the **[NVIDIA cuDNN Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)**.
      * Download the "cuDNN Library for Linux (x86\_64)" that matches your **CUDA 12.x** version.
      * This will download a tarball. Extract it and copy the `lib` and `include` files into your new CUDA 12.4 directory:
        ```bash
        tar -xvf cudnn-....-linux-x64-.....tgz
        sudo cp cudnn-*/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda-12.4/include/
        sudo cp cudnn-*/lib/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda-12.4/lib64/
        sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda-12.4/lib64/libcudnn*
        ```

4.  **Run Your App with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:**

      * Now, run your app, but prepend the command with the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This tells the dynamic linker to look in the CUDA 12.4 directory *before* any other system path.
      * `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.4/lib64 cargo run`

This command will find the `libcublas.so.12` (and others) that the downloaded `libonnxruntime.so` needs, and it will work.

-----

### Solution 2: The Robust Fix (Build `onnxruntime` Against CUDA 13)

This is the recommended long-term solution. You tell `ort` *not* to download its pre-built binary. Instead, you will build `onnxruntime` from source yourself, linking it against your system's native CUDA 13.

The `ort` crate highly recommends using its `load-dynamic` feature for this to "mitigate the shared library hell."

1.  **Modify Your `Cargo.toml`:**

      * Change your `ort` dependency to disable the default features (which include `download`) and explicitly enable `load-dynamic` and `cuda`.
      * ```toml
          [dependencies]
          ort = { version = "2.0.0", default-features = false, features = ["load-dynamic", "cuda"] }
        ```
      * *(Note: Use whatever `ort` version you have. This change requires at least `ort` 2.0.0-alpha.5)*

2.  **Build `onnxruntime` from Source:**

      * First, clone the `onnxruntime` repository.
        ```bash
        git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime.git
        cd onnxruntime
        ```
      * Run their build script. Point it to your system's CUDA 13 directory (which is likely `/usr/local/cuda` or `/usr/local/cuda-13.x`).
        ```bash
        # This command builds the shared library with CUDA support
        ./build.sh --config Release --build_shared_lib --parallel --use_cuda --cuda_home /usr/local/cuda --cudnn_home /usr/local/cuda
        ```

3.  **Run Your Rust App:**

      * The build script will create the `libonnxruntime.so` file in a directory like `./build/Linux/Release/lib/`.

      * Now, run your Rust app, but this time set two environment variables:

        1.  `ORT_DYLIB_PATH`: Tells the `ort` crate where to find the custom library you just built.
        2.  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: Tells the linker where to find your CUDA 13 libraries (just in case).

      * ```bash
          # Get the full path to your new library
          export ORT_LIB_PATH=$(pwd)/build/Linux/Release/lib
          export ORT_DYLIB_PATH=$ORT_LIB_PATH/libonnxruntime.so
          
          # Also add the CUDA 13 libs to the path
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORT_LIB_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
          
          # Now run your app (from your project's directory, not the onnxruntime dir)
          cd /path/to/your/mcp-server
          cargo run
        ```

This approach is more work upfront, but it's cleaner. Your Rust app will now be dynamically loading an `onnxruntime` library that is perfectly matched to your system's CUDA 13 environment.
