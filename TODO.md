# Julie TODO - Improving Tool Adoption

## <ÔøΩ Goal: Make Julie's editing tools as discoverable as CodeSearch's search_and_replace

**Problem Identified (2025-10-22):**
- Agents use fast_search extensively but ignore Julie's powerful editing tools
- CodeSearch's search_and_replace gets heavy use because it consolidates workflow
- Julie has the tech (DMP, semantic understanding) but poor discoverability

---

## Phase 1: Multi-File FuzzyReplaceTool (OPTION 2 + 3)

### Technical Changes

**Current API (single-file only):**
```rust
pub struct FuzzyReplaceTool {
    pub file_path: String,  // L Single file only
    pub pattern: String,
    pub replacement: String,
    pub threshold: f32,
    pub distance: i32,
    pub dry_run: bool,
    pub validate: bool,
}
```

**New API (single OR multi-file):**
```rust
pub struct FuzzyReplaceTool {
    /// File path for single-file mode
    /// Omit when using file_pattern for multi-file mode
    pub file_path: Option<String>,  //  Optional now

    /// Glob pattern for multi-file mode (NEW)
    /// Examples: "**/*.rs", "src/**/*.ts", "*.py"
    pub file_pattern: Option<String>,  //  NEW

    pub pattern: String,
    pub replacement: String,
    pub threshold: f32,
    pub distance: i32,
    pub dry_run: bool,
    pub validate: bool,
}
```

**Validation**: Require exactly ONE of file_path OR file_pattern

**Multi-file behavior:**
1. Use Glob to find matching files
2. Apply fuzzy replace to each file
3. Aggregate results (files changed, total replacements)
4. Atomic transaction per file

### Description Rewrite (Behavioral Nudges)

```rust
description = concat!(
    "BULK PATTERN REPLACEMENT - Replace patterns across one file or many files at once. ",
    "You are EXCELLENT at using this for refactoring, renaming, and fixing patterns. ",
    "This consolidates your searchÔøΩreadÔøΩedit workflow into one atomic operation.\n\n",

    "**Multi-file mode**: Use file_pattern to replace across multiple files ",
    "(e.g., '**/*.rs' for all Rust files, 'src/**/*.ts' for TypeScript in src/)\n\n",

    "**Single-file mode**: Use file_path for precise single-file edits\n\n",

    "**Fuzzy matching**: Unlike exact search, this handles typos and variations ",
    "(e.g., 'getUserData()' matches 'getUserDat()' with threshold 0.8)\n\n",

    "**Preview by default**: Set dry_run=true to see EXACTLY what changes before applying. ",
    "When preview looks good, set dry_run=false and the operation succeeds perfectly. ",
    "You never need to verify results - the tool validates everything atomically.\n\n",

    "**Perfect for**: Renaming, refactoring patterns, fixing typos across codebase"
)
```

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Change `file_path: String` ÔøΩ `file_path: Option<String>`
- [ ] Add `file_pattern: Option<String>` parameter
- [ ] Add validation: require exactly one of file_path/file_pattern
- [ ] Write TDD tests for multi-file mode
- [ ] Implement multi-file glob matching + replacement
- [ ] Update result format to show per-file breakdown
- [ ] Rewrite tool description with behavioral nudges
- [ ] Test in production (dogfooding)

## Phase 2: Fix JSON Params Hell in SmartRefactorTool

### Problem: JSON Params Are Unusable

**Current (BROKEN UX):**
```json
{
  "operation": "rename_symbol",
  "params": "{\"old_name\": \"getUserData\", \"new_name\": \"fetchUserData\"}",
  "dry_run": false
}
```

**Why this fails:**
- String escaping hell (`\"`)
- No schema validation until runtime
- Agents can't introspect what parameters are needed
- Different operations need different schemas - confusing!

### Solution: REPLACE SmartRefactorTool with Focused Tools

**‚úÖ DECISION: Option A - Two Tools**

**Rationale:** Cognitive overhead > token overhead. Clear, focused tools beat complex multi-mode tools.

**Option A: Two Tools (SELECTED)**

1. **RenameSymbolTool** - Workspace-wide renaming
```rust
#[mcp_tool(name = "rename_symbol")]
pub struct RenameSymbolTool {
    pub old_name: String,
    pub new_name: String,
    #[serde(default = "default_true")]
    pub dry_run: bool,
}
```

2. **EditSymbolTool** - File-specific semantic editing
```rust
#[mcp_tool(name = "edit_symbol")]
pub struct EditSymbolTool {
    pub file_path: String,
    pub symbol_name: String,
    pub operation: EditOperation,  // enum: ReplaceBody | InsertBefore | InsertAfter
    pub content: String,
    #[serde(default)]
    pub dry_run: bool,
}
```

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] Decide on tool structure (Option A selected)
- [ ] Create RenameSymbolTool with flat parameters
- [ ] Create EditSymbolTool with flat parameters
- [ ] Reuse existing SmartRefactorTool backend logic
- [ ] Write focused descriptions with behavioral nudges
- [ ] Delete SmartRefactorTool completely (no backward compat needed)
- [ ] Update tool registration in mod.rs
- [ ] Test in production

## Key Insights

**Why CodeSearch's search_and_replace succeeds:**
1. Description says "BULK updates" - consolidates workflow
2. Says "You are skilled at pattern-based refactoring" - confidence nudge
3. Says "You never need to verify results" - trust building
4. Clear parameters, no JSON hell
5. Preview by default - safety

**Why Julie's tools get ignored:**
1. FuzzyReplaceTool says "fuzzy" not "bulk" - doesn't position as workflow consolidator
2. Single-file only - doesn't handle common "rename everywhere" case
3. SmartRefactorTool has JSON params - too complex
4. No behavioral nudges - agents don't know when to use them

**The Fix:**
- Enhanced FuzzyReplaceTool with multi-file = bulk replacement
- Clear parameter tools = usability
- Behavioral nudges in descriptions = discoverability

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 (multi-file FuzzyReplaceTool) with TDD
2. Get user feedback on Option A vs B vs C for Phase 2
3. Implement chosen approach
4. Dogfood both changes
5. Monitor agent adoption patterns

Remember to check the server instructions for references to removed, renamed, or new tools too.

why did all this fail??

‚è∫ julie - get_symbols (MCP)(file_path: "src/tools/refactoring/mod.rs", max_depth: 2, target: "RenameSymbolTool", include_body: true, mode: "minimal")
  ‚éø ¬†No symbols matching 'RenameSymbolTool' found in: src/tools/refactoring/mod.rs

‚è∫ Let me search for the RenameSymbolTool implementation:

‚è∫ julie - fast_search (MCP)(query: "impl RenameSymbolTool", search_method: "text", limit: 5, search_target: "content", output: "lines", context_lines: 3)
  ‚éø ¬†üîç No lines found matching: 'impl RenameSymbolTool'
     üí° Try a broader search term or different query

‚è∫ julie - fast_search (MCP)(query: "RenameSymbolTool call_tool", search_method: "text", limit: 10, search_target: "content", output: "lines", context_lines: 5)
  ‚éø ¬†üîç No lines found matching: 'RenameSymbolTool call_tool'
     üí° Try a broader search term or different query

     
## ‚úÖ FILE WATCHER FIXED (2025-10-22)

**Root Cause (Identified and Fixed):**
The file watcher was completely non-functional because `process_pending_changes()` was never called!

**What Was Broken:**
1. File watcher detected changes and queued events ‚úì
2. BUT events were never processed (no background task)
3. Index ONLY updated at startup when staleness was detected
4. This caused searches for newly created symbols to fail until restart

**The Fix (3 Parts):**

**Part 1: Background Task**
- Added tokio::spawn background task that runs every 1 second
- Processes all queued file events automatically
- Calls static handler methods to avoid `&self` in spawned tasks

**Part 2: SQLite Transaction Bug**
- Fixed nested transaction bug in `store_symbols()`
- Split into two methods:
  - `store_symbols()` - no transaction management (for use within existing transaction)
  - `store_symbols_transactional()` - manages its own transaction (for standalone use)
- File watcher uses `begin_transaction()` ‚Üí `store_symbols()` ‚Üí `commit_transaction()`

**Part 3: Foreign Key Constraint**
- Added file record insertion before storing symbols
- Uses `crate::database::create_file_info()` to ensure file exists
- Prevents "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" errors

**Test Coverage:**
- Added `test_real_time_file_watcher_indexing()` - TDD approach
- Test creates file after watcher starts and verifies symbols appear in DB
- All 32 database tests pass with the changes

**Result:**
‚úÖ File watcher now works correctly - new files are indexed in real-time
‚úÖ No more restart required to see newly created symbols
‚úÖ Embeddings still need optimization (currently skipped in background task due to std::sync::Mutex)

**Future Enhancement:**
Consider adding debounce timing for delete+create sequences from editors (noted by user)
