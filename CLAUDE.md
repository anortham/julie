# CLAUDE.md - Project Julie Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

**Julie** is a cross-platform code intelligence server built in Rust, rising from Miller's ashes with the right architecture. Julie provides LSP-quality features across 20+ programming languages using tree-sitter parsers, Tantivy search, and semantic embeddings.

### Key Project Facts
- **Language**: Rust (native performance, true cross-platform)
- **Purpose**: Code intelligence MCP server (search, navigation, editing)
- **Architecture**: Single binary, no external dependencies
- **Origin**: Rebuilt from Miller (TypeScript/Bun) due to Windows compatibility issues
- **Crown Jewels**: 27 tree-sitter extractors with comprehensive test suites

## 🔴 CRITICAL: TDD Methodology (Non-Negotiable)

This project **MUST** follow Test-Driven Development:

### TDD Cycle for All Development
1. **RED**: Write a failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Bug Hunting Protocol
**NEVER** fix a bug without following this sequence:
1. **Find the bug** through investigation
2. **Write a failing test** that reproduces the bug exactly
3. **Verify the test fails** (confirms bug reproduction)
4. **Fix the bug** with minimal changes
5. **Verify the test passes** (confirms bug fixed)
6. **Ensure no regressions** (all other tests still pass)

### Test-First Examples
```rust
// ❌ WRONG: Implementing before testing
fn extract_typescript_functions() {
    // implementation code...
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Test first, then implement
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_extract_typescript_functions() {
        let code = "function getUserData() { return data; }";
        let symbols = extract_symbols(code);
        assert_eq!(symbols.len(), 1);
        assert_eq!(symbols[0].name, "getUserData");
        // This WILL FAIL initially - that's the point!
    }
}
```

## 🐕 Dogfooding Strategy

We will be using Julie to develop Julie (eating our own dog food):

### Development Workflow
1. **Development Mode**: Always work in `debug` mode for fast iteration
2. **Testing New Features**: When ready to test new functionality:
   - Agent asks user to exit Claude Code
   - User runs: `cargo build --release`
   - User restarts Claude Code with new Julie build
   - Test the new features in live MCP session

### Why This Matters
- **Real-world validation**: If Julie can't analyze its own code, it's not ready
- **Performance testing**: Large codebase stress testing
- **Usability validation**: We experience our own UX decisions

### Agent Instructions for Testing
When implementing new features, the agent should say:
> "The new [feature] is ready for testing. Please exit Claude Code, run `cargo build --release`, and restart Claude Code to test the new functionality."

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Core Design Decisions
1. **Native Rust**: No FFI, no CGO, no external dependencies
2. **Tree-sitter Native**: Direct Rust bindings for all language parsers
3. **Tantivy Search**: 2x faster than Lucene, pure Rust
4. **ONNX Embeddings**: ort crate for semantic understanding
5. **Single Binary**: Deploy anywhere, no runtime required

### Module Structure
```

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Extractors**: 100% test parity with Miller's test suites
- **Core Logic**: >90% coverage on search and navigation
- **MCP Tools**: Full integration testing
- **Cross-platform**: Automated testing on Windows, macOS, Linux

### Test Organization
```rust
// File: src/extractors/typescript.rs
pub struct TypeScriptExtractor { /* ... */ }

// File: src/tests/typescript_tests.rs
#[cfg(test)]
mod typescript_extractor_tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_extract_function_declarations() {
        // Port Miller's test cases exactly
    }
}
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
cargo test

# Specific extractor
cargo test typescript_extractor

# With logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test

# Release mode (performance testing)
cargo test --release
```

---

## 🎯 Performance Targets (Non-Negotiable)

Julie must significantly outperform Miller:

### Benchmarks
- **Search Latency**: <10ms (vs Miller's 50ms)
- **Parsing Speed**: 5-10x faster than Miller
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB typical (vs Miller's ~500MB)
- **Startup Time**: <1s cold start
- **Indexing Speed**: Process 1000 files in <30s

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Benchmark suite
cargo bench

# Profile memory usage
valgrind --tool=massif cargo run --release

# Profile CPU usage
perf record cargo run --release
perf report
```

---

## 🔧 Development Commands

### Daily Development
```bash
# Fast iteration (debug build)
cargo build && cargo run

# Run specific tests during development
cargo test typescript_extractor --no-capture

# Watch for changes
cargo watch -x "build" -x "test"

# Check for issues
cargo clippy
cargo fmt
```

### Release Preparation
```bash
# Optimized build
cargo build --release

# Cross-platform builds
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --release
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release

# Size optimization
cargo bloat --release
```

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### Must-Have Requirements
1. **Windows Compatibility**: Single `cargo build` must work on Windows
2. **Test Parity**: Every Miller test must pass in Julie
3. **Performance**: 5-10x improvement over Miller
4. **Memory Safety**: No unsafe code unless absolutely necessary
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper error types

### Deal Breakers
- CGO/FFI dependencies (breaks Windows compatibility)
- External runtime requirements (breaks single binary goal)
- Slower than Miller (defeats the purpose of rewrite)
- Test failures (indicates incomplete migration)

---

## 🎪 Migration Strategy from Miller

### Extractor Porting Process
1. **Copy Miller's tests exactly** - Don't change test logic
2. **Create Rust extractor structure** - Following base extractor pattern
3. **Port logic incrementally** - Function by function with tests
4. **Verify 100% test pass rate** - No compromises

### Test Suite Validation
```bash
# Miller had these test files - all must pass in Julie:
typescript-extractor.test.ts -> typescript_tests.rs
javascript-extractor.test.ts -> javascript_tests.rs
python-extractor.test.ts -> python_tests.rs
# ... and 24 more extractors
```

---

## 🔍 Debugging Guidelines

### Logging Strategy
```rust
use tracing::{debug, info, warn, error};

// Use structured logging
debug!(file_path = %path, symbols_found = symbols.len(), "Extracted symbols");
```

### Debug Mode Features
- Detailed tracing logs
- Symbol extraction debugging
- Search query analysis
- Performance timing

### Production Mode
- Minimal logging
- Error reporting only
- Optimized performance
- No debug overhead

---

## 📦 Dependencies Management

### Core Dependencies (Already in Cargo.toml)
- `rust-mcp-sdk`: MCP protocol implementation
- `tree-sitter`: Parser framework with all language bindings
- `tantivy`: Search engine
- `ort`: ONNX runtime for embeddings
- `tokio`: Async runtime
- `rayon`: Data parallelism

### Adding New Dependencies
Before adding any dependency, consider:
1. Does it break single binary deployment?
2. Does it require external libraries?
3. Is it cross-platform compatible?
4. Does it impact startup time significantly?

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase must meet these criteria:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Cross-platform builds successful
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] No regressions from previous phases

### Final Success Definition
Julie is successful when:
1. **All Miller tests pass** in Rust
2. **Performance targets exceeded** (5-10x improvement)
3. **Windows deployment works** (single binary)
4. **Dogfooding successful** (can analyze its own code)
5. **Production ready** (stable, fast, reliable)
