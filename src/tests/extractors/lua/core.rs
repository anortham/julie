//! Tests for the core Lua symbol extraction and tree traversal logic.
//! These tests were originally defined in the core module and have been
//! extracted to follow the standard test organization pattern.

        // Basic tree traversal is tested through public API in integration tests
        // This ensures consistency with full extraction pipeline
