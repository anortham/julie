## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Tree-sitter Integration** - Must work perfectly before extractor porting
2. **Test Parity** - Each extractor must pass 100% of Miller's tests
3. **MCP Compatibility** - Must maintain full compatibility with MCP protocol
4. **Performance Targets** - Sub-10ms search is non-negotiable

### Fallback Plans
1. If ONNX embeddings fail → Use simpler TF-IDF initially
2. If Tantivy has issues → Fall back to simple indexing with sled
3. If tree-sitter binding issues → Use subprocess calls as temporary measure
4. If Windows build fails → Prioritize macOS/Linux, fix Windows later

### Testing Strategy
- **TDD Approach**: Write failing test first, then implement
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage on core functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Automated benchmarks on every commit
- **Integration Tests**: Full MCP protocol testing
- **Platform Tests**: Automated testing on all target platforms

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All Miller extractor tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Search latency under 10ms (measured)
- [ ] Memory usage under 100MB typical (profiled)
- [ ] Single binary deployment (verified)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (tested)
- [ ] 5-10x performance improvement over Miller (benchmarked)
