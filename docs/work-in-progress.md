## =ï¿½ Verified Implementation Details

All details below are **VERIFIED** from actual coa-codesearch-mcp and coa-mcp-framework code:

### TokenEstimator ( IMPLEMENTED)
```rust
// VERIFIED ratios from TokenEstimator.cs:32,37
const CHARS_PER_TOKEN: f64 = 4.0;        // English

// VERIFIED hybrid formula from TokenEstimator.cs:86
// 0.6 * char_based + 0.4 * word_based

// VERIFIED CJK detection ranges from TokenEstimator.cs:138-143
// 0x4E00-0x9FFF (CJK Unified), 0x3040-0x30FF (Hiragana/Katakana), etc.
```

### Progressive Reduction (VERIFIED)
```rust
// VERIFIED steps from StandardReductionStrategy.cs:8
let reduction_steps = [100, 75, 50, 30, 20, 10, 5];

// VERIFIED implementation from line 35
let count = std::cmp::max(1, (items.len() * percentage) / 100);
```

### Scoring System (VERIFIED)
```rust
// VERIFIED from PathRelevanceFactor.cs:151
const TEST_FILE_PENALTY: f32 = 0.15;  // When not searching "test"

// VERIFIED from PathRelevanceFactor.cs:179
const PRODUCTION_BOOST: f32 = 1.2;

// VERIFIED directory weights from lines 25-58
// src=1.0, test=0.4, docs=0.2, node_modules=0.1
```

### Response Modes (VERIFIED)
```rust
// VERIFIED from LineSearchResponseBuilder.cs:229
// summary: 3 files, 3 lines per file
// normal: 10 files, 10 lines per file (default)
// full: 20 files, 20 lines per file
// exhaustive: 50 files, 50 lines per file
```

### Token Budget Allocation (VERIFIED)
```rust
// VERIFIED from SearchResponseBuilder.cs:38-40
let data_budget = (token_budget * 0.7) as usize;      // 70% for data
let insights_budget = (token_budget * 0.15) as usize; // 15% for insights
let actions_budget = (token_budget * 0.15) as usize;  // 15% for actions
```

### Token Limits (VERIFIED)
```rust
// VERIFIED defaults from multiple tools
const DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIMIT: usize = 8000;  // Per tool
const SAFETY_BUDGET: usize = 2000;        // 40% of max, capped at 2000
const MAX_TOKEN_RANGE: (usize, usize) = (100, 100_000);
```

## <ï¿½ Architecture Integration

### Current Problem Location
**File**: `/Users/murphy/Source/julie/src/tools/search.rs`
**Lines**: 285-291 - Full context inclusion causing token explosion:

```rust
// PROBLEM: This includes ALL context without limits
if let Some(context) = &symbol.code_context {
    lines.push("   =ï¿½ Context:".to_string());
    for context_line in context.lines() {
        lines.push(format!("   {}", context_line));
    }
}
```

### Solution Approach
1. **Pre-flight estimation**: Check token count BEFORE building response
2. **Smart truncation**: Keep signatures, docstrings, return statements
3. **Progressive reduction**: Apply verified reduction steps if needed
4. **Resource URIs**: Store full results, return URIs when truncated

---

## =, Testing Strategy

### Real-World Validation
- **Test Query**: `fast_search(query: "extractor", mode: "text", limit: 10)`
- **Current**: 149,505 tokens (FAILS)
- **Target**: <15,000 tokens (90% reduction)
- **Quality**: Maintain search relevance with scoring improvements

### Test Cases
1. **Token estimation accuracy** - Compare with actual MCP response sizes
2. **CJK handling** - Japanese/Chinese code comments and strings
3. **Progressive reduction** - Verify graceful degradation
4. **Context preservation** - Keep essential code structure
5. **Cross-language** - Test all 26 supported languages

---

## =ï¿½ Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **90% token reduction**: 149K ï¿½ <15K tokens
- **2-3x quality improvement**: Via scoring and relevance
- **Sub-10ms latency**: Maintain blazing search speed
- **100% backward compatibility**: Gradual rollout

### Quality Measures
- **Relevance scoring**: Boost production code over tests
- **Exact match priority**: Logarithmic boost for perfect matches
- **Context preservation**: Never break mid-statement
- **Smart truncation**: Keep function signatures intact

## <ï¿½ Implementation Notes

### Battle-Tested Patterns
These patterns have been proven at scale in codesearch with **months of optimization work**:

1. **Character-based estimation** is more reliable than word-based for code
2. **CJK detection** is essential for international codebases
3. **Progressive reduction** provides graceful degradation
4. **Path scoring** dramatically improves result quality
5. **Token budgets** prevent runaway responses

### TDD Approach
Following project guidelines with test-first development:
-  TokenEstimator: 3 tests passing (empty, English, CJK)
- = Next: Context truncation tests
- =ï¿½ Then: Progressive reduction tests
- <ï¿½ Finally: Integration with search tool

### Performance Considerations
- **Pre-compilation**: Cache token estimators and scoring
- **Lazy evaluation**: Don't process more than needed
- **Early termination**: Stop at token limits
- **Memory efficiency**: Stream processing for large results

---

## =ï¿½ Next Steps

1. **Implement context truncation** with symbol-aware line limits
2. **Add progressive reduction** using verified reduction steps
3. **Integrate TokenEstimator** into search tool with pre-flight checks
4. **Test with real "extractor" query** to validate 90% token reduction
5. **Add scoring improvements** for 2-3x quality boost

**Target**: Transform the 149K token crisis into a <15K token success story while improving search quality.
