# Project Julie: Cross-Platform Code Intelligence Server
*Rising from Miller's ashes with the right architecture*

## Executive Summary

After extensive research and learning from Miller's Windows failures, **Rust** is the clear choice for Project Julie. The primary issues with Miller stem from using JavaScript/Bun with process spawning and IPC, which fundamentally breaks on Windows. Rust provides native performance, true cross-platform support, and eliminates all IPC/CGO complexity.

## üî¥ Critical Lessons from Miller's Failure

### What Went Wrong
1. **Bun's Windows IPC is broken** - Process spawning doesn't work reliably
2. **Architecture assumed Unix** - Process pools, IPC, file descriptors
3. **Wrong language for the task** - JavaScript for CPU-intensive parsing and embeddings
4. **No Windows testing** - Discovered issues only after implementation

### What We Built That's Valuable
- ‚úÖ 20 working language extractors with deep AST knowledge
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suites for each language
- ‚úÖ Understanding of symbol extraction patterns
- ‚úÖ Cross-language binding detection logic

## üéØ Critical Dependencies Analysis

### 1. Tree-sitter (Foundation)
| Aspect | **Rust** | **Go** |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Binding Quality | ‚úÖ **Native** - Tree-sitter is written in Rust | ‚ö†Ô∏è Via CGO (C interface) |
| Memory Management | ‚úÖ Automatic with RAII | ‚ùå Manual Close() calls required |
| Performance | ‚úÖ Direct calls, no FFI overhead | ‚ö†Ô∏è CGO overhead (~10-15%) |
| Windows Support | ‚úÖ Native compilation | ‚ö†Ô∏è CGO complications |
| **Verdict** | **Clear Winner** | Functional but suboptimal |

### 2. Code Search (Not Prose)
| Library | Language | Performance | Memory | Features |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|----------|
| **Tantivy** | Rust | 2x faster than Lucene | Moderate | BM25, facets, multi-threaded |
| **Bleve** | Go | Good | Higher (83K LOC) | tf-idf, schema-free |
| **Sonic** | Rust | Very fast | Minimal | No document storage |
| **MeiliSearch** | Rust | Fast | Moderate | Full solution (not library) |
| **Verdict** | **Tantivy (Rust)** | **Bleve (Go)** | - | - |

### 3. Embeddings
| Solution | **Rust** | **Go** |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **ONNX Runtime** | ‚úÖ ort crate, native | ‚úÖ ONNX-go available |
| **Native Options** | ‚úÖ Candle (no deps) | ‚ö†Ô∏è spago (requires C++) |
| **Model Support** | ‚úÖ BERT, T5, LLaMA | ‚úÖ BERT via gobert/spago |
| **Performance** | ‚úÖ Fastest | ‚ö†Ô∏è CGO overhead |
| **Memory Control** | ‚úÖ Precise | ‚ö†Ô∏è GC pauses possible |
| **Verdict** | **Superior** | Functional but dependencies |

## üî¥ Critical Windows Issues Discovered

### Go + CGO = Windows Pain
```bash
# This is what Go requires for Windows with tree-sitter:
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 CC="x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc" go build

# Problems:
1. Requires MinGW-w64 toolchain
2. CGO breaks pure Go's cross-compilation
3. Static binaries are "arcane" to build
4. Each C dependency needs Windows-specific handling
```

### Rust = Just Works‚Ñ¢
```bash
# This is Rust for Windows:
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
# Done. No toolchain setup. No CGO. Just a binary.
```

## üìä Performance Comparison Grid

| Metric | **Rust** | **Go** | **Real-World Impact** |
|--------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Tree-sitter Parsing** | 100% baseline | 85-90% (CGO overhead) | ~1000ms vs 1100ms for 1000 files |
| **Search Latency** | <5ms (Tantivy) | <10ms (Bleve) | Both acceptable |
| **Embedding Generation** | 50-100ms/batch | 60-120ms/batch | Rust 20% faster |
| **Memory Usage** | Precise control | GC overhead (+20-30%) | Matters at scale |
| **Binary Size** | 15-20MB | 10-15MB | Go slightly smaller |
| **Startup Time** | <100ms | <50ms | Go faster cold start |
| **Compilation Speed** | 30-60s | 5-10s | Go 6x faster iteration |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Comparison

### Rust Architecture (Clean)
```rust
// Everything in one process, true parallelism
let pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new()
    .num_threads(num_cpus::get())
    .build()?;

pool.install(|| {
    files.par_iter().for_each(|file| {
        let tree = parser.parse_file(file);  // Direct Rust call
        let symbols = extractor.extract(tree); // No FFI
        tantivy_index.add(symbols);           // Native Rust
        let embedding = candle.embed(symbols); // Pure Rust
        store.save(embedding);                 // All in-process
    });
});
```

### Go Architecture (CGO Complexity)
```go
// CGO required for tree-sitter
// #cgo LDFLAGS: -ltree-sitter
// #include <tree_sitter/api.h>
import "C"

func processFile(file string) {
    tree := parser.Parse(file)  // CGO call
    defer tree.Close()          // Manual memory management!
    symbols := extractSymbols(tree)

    // Goroutines work great for pure Go
    go func() {
        index.Add(symbols)      // Pure Go (Bleve)
        embedding := onnx.Embed(symbols) // Might need CGO
        store.Save(embedding)
    }()
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Hidden Gotchas We Must Address

### If We Choose Go:
1. **CGO kills Windows cross-compilation** - Need separate Windows CI
2. **Manual memory management** for tree-sitter - Potential leaks
3. **GC pauses** during embedding generation - UI stutters
4. **C dependencies** for some ML libraries - Deployment complexity

### If We Choose Rust:
1. **Slower development** initially - Borrow checker learning curve
2. **Longer compile times** - But incremental builds help
3. **Fewer developers know Rust** - Maintenance concerns
4. **Async complexity** - Tokio vs async-std decisions

## üéØ The Verdict

Based on this research, **Rust is the clear winner** for Project Julie:

### Why Rust Wins:
1. **Tree-sitter is native Rust** - No FFI, no CGO, just works
2. **Windows compilation is trivial** - One command, no toolchains
3. **Tantivy beats all search options** - 2x Lucene performance
4. **Candle/ort for embeddings** - No C++ dependencies
5. **True zero-cost parallelism** - Rayon just works everywhere
6. **Single static binary** - Deploy anywhere

### The Only Go Advantages:
- ‚úÖ Faster compilation (6x)
- ‚úÖ Easier to learn
- ‚úÖ Faster prototyping

But these are **development conveniences**, not production requirements.

## üìã Project Julie Implementation Plan

### Technology Stack
```toml
[dependencies]
language = "Rust"
parser = "tree-sitter"      # Native Rust
search = "tantivy"         # 2x faster than alternatives
embeddings = "candle"      # Or ort if we need specific models
database = "rusqlite"      # SQLite bindings
async_runtime = "tokio"    # Industry standard
web_framework = "axum"     # For MCP server
parallelism = "rayon"      # Data parallelism
serialization = "serde_json"
```

### Why This Will Work on Windows
- No CGO
- No external toolchains
- No IPC
- No process spawning
- Just threads and channels
- Single static binary output

## üìà Expected Improvements Over Miller

| Aspect | Miller (Bun/TS) | Julie (Rust) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Windows Support | ‚ùå Broken | ‚úÖ Native | Fixed |
| Performance | Slow (IPC overhead) | Fast (native) | 5-10x |
| Memory Usage | ~500MB | ~100MB | 5x reduction |
| Deployment | Complex (runtime) | Single binary | Simplified |
| Parallelism | Process spawning | Native threads | 10x efficiency |
| Search Speed | 50ms | <5ms | 10x faster |
| Embedding Speed | Hangs | 50-100ms | Actually works |

## üéØ Success Criteria

1. **Must Work on Windows** - No IPC, no CGO, no external dependencies
2. **Sub-10ms Search** - Using Tantivy's native performance
3. **Single Binary** - No runtime, no dependencies
4. **True Parallelism** - Utilize all CPU cores efficiently
5. **Reuse Miller's Knowledge** - Port extractors and tests

## Conclusion

Project Julie represents a complete architectural shift from Miller's JavaScript/process-based approach to a native Rust implementation. This isn't just a port - it's building the system we should have built from the beginning, with the hard-won knowledge of what actually works across platforms.

The extractors and test suites from Miller are valuable IP that will transfer directly. The architecture mistakes won't. Julie will be what Miller was supposed to be: a truly cross-platform, high-performance code intelligence server that actually works on Windows.
