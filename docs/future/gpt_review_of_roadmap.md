 ● Here’s a concise review based on the roadmap and the current implementation I
   inspected in this repo.

   What I looked at

     * Roadmap: docs/future/agent_first_tool_roadmap.md
     * Tools and how they use the stack:
       * src/tools/search.rs (FastSearchTool)

       * src/tools/fuzzy_replace.rs (FuzzyReplaceTool)

       * src/tools/trace_call_path.rs (TraceCallPathTool)

       * src/tools/refactoring.rs (SmartRefactorTool)

       * src/tools/mod.rs (tool registry)

       * search stack: src/search/{mod.rs,schema.rs,tokenizers.rs}

       * extractors: src/extractors/{base.rs,mod.rs}

       * workspace/db/embeddings modules (directory structure)

   High-level opinion on the project goals

     * Clear, agent-first thesis: Tools are built to reduce retries, avoid zero-result dead ends, and optimize token budget. This is the right focus—agents
   choose tools that produce deterministic, composable, low-token answers.
     * CASCADE architecture is solid: SQLite single source of truth → Tantivy for fast text → HNSW embeddings for semantics. Per-workspace isolation is a
   big win for performance and correctness.
     * “No tool explosion” and “structured results for chaining” are the right guardrails. The roadmap’s emphasis on structured outputs and next-action
   hints is exactly what agents need to chain steps confidently.

   How the core stack is used today (from the code)

     * SQLite (rusqlite):
       * Primary source of truth; used for fallback search (FTS5 in FastSearchTool.sqlite_fts_search).

       * Used to store symbols, relationships, and to fetch symbols by ID for semantic matches (SmartRefactor, TraceCallPath).
     * Tantivy:
       * Per-workspace index is used where available (FastSearchTool.text_search → handler.active_search_engine / workspace.search).

       * Code-aware tokenizer exists (tokenizers.rs) with camelCase and snake_case splits, good for multi-word and identifier matching.

       * Schema is thoughtfully designed (schema.rs) with exact fields, code_context, signature, doc_comment, language_boost, and an all_text aggregator.

       * Query intent scaffolding exists (QueryProcessor in schema.rs) but isn’t wired into FastSearchTool yet.
     * Tree-sitter:
       * Extractor base and symbol creation port is thorough (base.rs). Symbols include code_context extraction with line windows and UTF-8 safety (good).

       * SmartRefactorTool uses AST (via a per-language language::get_tree_sitter_language) to locate/rename/replace safely, with sensible fallbacks.
     * Embeddings + HNSW:
       * Vector store integration with lazy ensure, HNSW-search, then back to SQLite fetch by symbol_id (FastSearchTool.semantic_search). Good CASCADE and
   readiness checks.

       * TraceCallPath uses embeddings for semantic neighbors to bridge cross-language traces (a real differentiator).

   Quality assessment Strengths

     * The architecture is cohesive. Tools use the CASCADE properly with readiness checks and graceful degradations (SystemReadiness in FastSearchTool).
     * Search stack is code-aware:
       * Custom tokenizer splits identifiers and paths well.

       * Schema covers exact, tokenized, and context-bearing fields.

       * Path relevance + exact-match boosting in FastSearchTool gives higher-quality ranking than naive BM25 alone.
     * Editing safety is considered:
       * SmartRefactor uses AST + diff-match-patch for atomic changes via EditingTransaction.

       * FuzzyReplace adds bracket/paren/brace balance validation (delta-aware), previews, and temp-file write before rename.
     * Interop mindset:
       * FastSearchTool builds an “OptimizedResponse” and suggests next actions.

       * SmartRefactor parses structured refs when present; TraceCallPath outputs depth/levels and similarity annotations.

   Gaps/risks worth addressing

     * FuzzyReplace “DMP” mismatch: The tool header claims DMP, but matching is a hand-rolled Levenshtein sliding window; diff/patch is not used here for
   the match/replace phase. This is fine (and sometimes better for speed), but the docs and name suggest DMP fuzzy matching. Either wire in DMP’s matching
   for consistency or adjust wording to “Levenshtein-based fuzzy replace” in help text.
     * FuzzyReplace safety path: It writes temp file then rename (atomic), but it bypasses the shared EditingTransaction used elsewhere. Consider
   standardizing on EditingTransaction for uniformity and future safety hooks (backups, post-parse validation).
     * Search intent and query planner: QueryProcessor exists but isn’t integrated into FastSearchTool yet. As a result, multi-word behavior and
   exact/phrase choices are left to Tantivy defaults and ad hoc logic rather than a unified policy.
     * Context with results: Symbols can carry code_context, but many search hits won’t have precomputed context stored in the index. The roadmap asks to
   “return context lines”; this needs a quick path to load-and-slice file lines around hit regions when code_context is None.
     * Workspace filter: search_workspace_tantivy currently errors for non-primary workspaces. Roadmap wants cross-workspace search; right now it’s “primary
    only.”
     * Hybrid mode: FastSearchTool.hybrid_search is just text fallback; no fusion/reranking yet.
     * Standardized structured outputs: Some tools already add structured content; others still only return text. The roadmap’s “actions” and structured
   schema should be standardized across all tools.

   Roadmap feedback (by item)

     1. AST-Based Reformat/Fix Tool

     * Strong idea with very high agent value (reduce retries, give deterministic recovery).
     * Implementation suggestion:
       * Start with validate + diagnose (parse with tree-sitter; surface error nodes and nearest offending tokens).

       * Auto-fix v1: brace/paren/indent heuristics per language group (C-like vs Python indentation), then re-parse to confirm.

       * Expose both file and “string snippet” targets so tools can validate before writing.

     1. Smart Read Tool

     * Big token savings. Recommend building it atop GetSymbolsTool, adding include_body and dependency expansion modes.
     * v1: Return complete AST nodes for a target + import/type dependencies via a simple fan-in graph walk, not full semantic resolution. Respect AST
   boundaries to avoid partial blocks.
     * v2: Add “business_logic” mode by excluding test/framework folders and low-signal files using path heuristics + simple import graph centrality.

     1. Semantic Diff Tool

     * Right direction. v1 suggestion: Start with “structural + behavioral hints” combining:
       * DMP text diff for hunks

       * AST re-parse before/after to classify moves vs changes

       * Light-weight semantic similarity at function level to classify “moved unchanged” vs “refactored” vs “behavior changed.”
     * Defer impact radius integration (refs/trace) to v2 once the basics work reliably.

     1. Enhanced fast_explore Onboarding

     * The scoring formula is sound. v1 suggestion:
       * Use existing symbol/relationship graph to compute fan-in/fan-out centrality.

       * Use embeddings to cluster but only for a handful of core files to control compute.

       * Add path rules immediately (skip tests/node_modules/vendor).

       * Save the rankings to structured output (top N files with reasons) and attach suggested “open next” actions.

     1. Auto-Generate Agent Documentation

     * This will make a huge difference. v1 can be quite effective:
       * Detect tech stack from Cargo.toml, package.json, etc.

       * Pull top-N critical files from onboarding mode.

       * Include “How to run/build/test” from config files and existing README.

       * Keep it concise and agent-oriented; avoid boilerplate.

     1. Search improvements (zero-result fixes)

     * Quick wins:
       * Integrate QueryProcessor into FastSearchTool: detect ExactSymbol / FilePath / Mixed intents and transform queries before hitting Tantivy.

       * Always return a small context window (±3–5 lines) for hits lacking index-stored context by on-demand file read.

       * When empty, emit “query suggestions” based on edit distance and token splits (you already have Levenshtein in FuzzyReplace and a tokenizer for
   splits—reuse).
     * Stop premature SQLite fallback unless Tantivy truly fails; prefer a second pass with relaxed query (AND→OR fallback with ranking).

   Concrete suggestions to improve existing/proposed tooling Low effort, high
   impact (do these first)

     * Wire QueryProcessor into FastSearchTool.search:
       * ExactSymbol → quote the symbol_name_exact field

       * Multi-word → AND-first across split tokens, then OR fallback with rank penalties

       * Operator/file-path intents → route to specific fields to avoid zero hits
     * Return context lines reliably:
       * If symbol.code_context is None, open the file and slice ±N lines around start_line..end_line for display. Keep it to at most 8–10 lines.
     * Standardize structured outputs:
       * All search/navigation/edit tools should return a common structured payload: {file_path, language, start_line, end_line, start_byte, end_byte,
   symbol:{name,kind,signature?}, actions:{...}}. You already do parts of this; make it universal.
     * Fix FuzzyReplace docstrings/help:
       * Clarify it’s Levenshtein-based fuzzy matching (unless you plan to bring in DMP’s fuzzy matcher). Consider delegating file write to
   EditingTransaction for consistency.
     * Implement non-primary workspace Tantivy search:
       * Load per-workspace index dynamically (even if cached) to fulfill the workspace=ID promise.

   Medium effort

     * “smart_read” MVP:
       * Extend GetSymbolsTool to accept target symbol and include_body.

       * AST boundary extraction for function/class nodes and their immediate dependencies (import/type aliases).
     * “ast_fix validate/diagnose” MVP:
       * Parse with tree-sitter, list error nodes with line/column and a short hint per language family. Don’t attempt automatic edits yet—just unlock
   instant diagnosis.
     * Hybrid search v1:
       * Text search top-N, then HNSW rerank (or union with semantic top-M) and re-score using weighted blend (exact boost + path relevance + BM25 +
   semantic sim).

   Higher effort (phase 3–4)

     * Semantic diff v1 (function-level):
       * For each changed function, compute embedding similarity old↔new. Classify moved/renamed vs refactor vs behavioral change based on AST shape +
   similarity threshold.

   Guardrails and safety

     * After any editing operation (SmartRefactor or FuzzyReplace), optionally re-parse the changed files with tree-sitter and fail fast if syntax breaks
   (this can be the validate mode of ast_fix).
     * Respect blacklists everywhere (shared::BLACKLISTED_DIRECTORIES/EXTENSIONS already re-exported): ensure all tools check them consistently.
     * For bulk changes like rename_symbol, surface a DRY RUN summary by default and require explicit confirmation to apply.

   Metrics to track (to prove the roadmap)

     * Search: zero-result rate, retries per successful result, average results confidence, percent of results with context.
     * Editing: failure rate due to syntax errors pre- and post-ast_fix, frequency of dry-run vs apply, revert rate.
     * Token: average tokens per search→read→edit workflow before/after smart_read.
     * Adoption: percent of calls that chain via actions fields (shows interop working).

   Overall quality assessment

     * The codebase reflects strong engineering choices and clear attention to agent UX. The roadmap aligns tightly with what is already built:
   per-workspace isolation, custom tokenizer, schema designed for exact + tokenized + context, and semantic capabilities are all there.
     * Main deltas to close are wiring the query planner, standardizing structured outputs and actions, and delivering the first MVPs of smart_read and
   ast_fix. These will drastically reduce retries, zero-result frustration, and wasted tokens—exactly the roadmap’s intent.
